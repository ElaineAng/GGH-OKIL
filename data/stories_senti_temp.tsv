"In \How to Make Wealth\"" PG puts forward the following argument:<p>1. Assume a hacker can make a good wage working for someone else.<p>2. Assume a hacker can in turn be significantly more productive working for themselves.<p>3. All things being equal, a hacker should be able to make significantly more money by working for themselves (albeit at the cost of increased risk and stress).<p>The relevant quote: \""If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smart hacker working very hard ... should be able to do work worth about $3 million a year.\""<p>My question to HN is as follows:<p>Excluding outliers such as Gates/Zuckerberg, is the inference that a good hacker can make more from the market directly actually valid?<p>If so, why does it seem most hackers struggle to capture even

33k.  This is a result of being mentioned on more mainstream sites. I hope this spike will subside, like past ones have.  In the meantime I may temporarily hack a few things to make the site faster, like putting fewer results on threads pages.<p>You can help the spike subside by making HN look extra boring. For the next couple days it would be better to have posts about the innards of Erlang than women who create sites to get hired by Twitter."	01326270	mjfern	mjfern	122	1273192294	2010-05-07 00:31:34 UTC	270	What iPads Did To My Family	http://chucksblog.emc.com/chucks_blog/2010/05/what-ipads-did-to-my-family.html		09956415	samfpetersen	samfpetersen	134	1438016283	2015-07-27 16:58:03 UTC	270	Show HN: A Hand-Drawn QR Code Alternative	http://www.meshtag.com		01299029	wyclif	wyclif	160	1272391050	2010-04-27 17:57:30 UTC	270	Learn Python The Hard Way: a new book by Zed Shaw	http://learnpythonthehardway.com/		02281045	brown9-2	brown9-2	115	1299096363	2011-03-02 20:06:03 UTC	526	Man upgrades Windows 1.0 to Windows 7 (video)	http://www.winrumors.com/man-upgrades-windows-1-0-to-windows-7-via-every-other-windows-versions/		08602936	cpenner461	cpenner461	158	1415901729	2014-11-13 18:02:09 UTC	526	AWS Lambda	http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/		04627106	feronull	feronull	159	1349708240	2012-10-08 14:57:20 UTC	526	"Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and others launch webplatform.org"	http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/08/apple-facebook-google-microsoft-and-others-join-forces-to-launch-new-web-standards-resource		04068561	krschultz	krschultz	196	1338903497	2012-06-05 13:38:17 UTC	526	"Kids should be building rockets and robots, not taking standardized tests"	http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2012/06/maker_faire_and_science_education_american_kids_should_be_building_rockets_and_robots_not_taking_standardized_tests_.html		0218664	blang	blang	80	1213628205	2008-06-16 14:56:45 UTC	15	Ask HN: Do you swear in your code?

"I am a full-time software developer looking for extra income. I spend a lot of time &quot;cold-emailing&quot; local businesses and messaging other companies who are actually looking for applicants. The result is always the same: &quot;we are not looking for freelancers&#x2F;contractors right now&quot;.<p>I have also used freelance sites before (unsuccessfully) like ODesk and Elance, and I have really hated how they work. It seems like all freelancing on those sites is a price war. I am confident about my skill-set and I&#x27;m not worried about not being able to deliver, but the way bidding is organized on these sites feels really demeaning.<p>So ultimately, my question for HN is how do YOU find or establish new freelance&#x2F;sub-contracting&#x2F;contracting gigs? Should I just deal with my annoyance at ODesk&#x2F;Elance or are there methods I&#x27;m missing?

"I've just finished sophomore year at a good liberal arts university.<p>I have two more years left here; what should I try to do? What should I bias for? What do you, someone who is no longer in college, wish you did, and found most useful during your time there?<p>More about me: So far, I've spent most of my time learning how to do work, then how to do hard work, and about myself (ADHD, etc). (In fact, I'm procrastinating right now.) I spent most of my childhood doing what I was interested in (lego, then computers), which doesn't develop the skills needed for college.<p>I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics double major, but I'm not sure if I'm clever enough for pure math; I am aceing the CS classes, though. I'm vaguely participating in a startup-like venture, but there is little pressure, and hence little actual startup atmosphere - but still good experience. I've thought many times about dropping out (of college), but I seriously don't have a plan, aside from the vague notion of \going to SF and figuring something out\"". Besides, it seems like a good idea to get a college degree + the CS/Math sophistication alongside it. Nevertheless, I'm quite bored, by the vapid partying (which I refuse to take part in - decimating my social life), the happy-go-lucky attitude of most people, and lectures + homework in general.<p>My life goals? I want excitement (see ADHD, above). Maybe with computers. The current startup frenzy seems to fit like a glove, but I've only heard about it on the internet."""	0176251	ashu	ashu	96	1209438390	2008-04-29 03:06:30 UTC	24	My Mac Mini	http://mattmaroon.com/?p=359		07745547	RougeFemme	RougeFemme	117	1400094004	2014-05-14 19:00:04 UTC	24	"'I'm Happy,' Says Man Whose Case Changed Europe's Rules For Google"	http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/05/14/312430713/-i-m-happy-says-man-whose-case-changed-europe-s-rules-for-google		0364219	bbuderi	bbuderi	163	1226668505	2008-11-14 13:15:05 UTC	24	"Attention, Startups: Move to New England.

"I am coming back to the IT industry after about 6 years of being involved in something completely unrelated. My partner and I are starting a startup that��_�s going to make a online blogging application for a niche market. If we are successful, the application would need to be able to scale to handle a lot of users (100k visitor per day if we are successful, nothing like FB levels or something). Because it��_�s going to be a blogging platform with a business model similar to squarespace.com, the load will be distributed over many different domains, making it easier to scale.<p>Both my partner and I have good knowledge of PHP. However, due to the complexity of the project, we will have to find additional developers anyway. From what I read online Node.js and Go are the in thing right now, and scale much better than PHP. My question is, should we stick with the ��_��_��_Devil we know,��_� PHP, or dive into learning and developing in Node.js or Go.

What's a good alternative?		"To me, the modern IDE has become so bloated these days I dread to even think about firing one open and letting it consume a horrendous amount of resources.<p>So what's the alternative? People have spoken about Vim and Emacs and all the others, but I'm not very well versed in either. I've been using Vim for quite a while to write simple scripts so I'm used to the commonly used keyboard commands, but I'm still a bit confused about how people use their preferred editor as a full blown development environment. Vim to me seems like an ever expanding series of configuration files and keyboard tricks to get something remotely powerful.<p>What I'm asking is, what is the alternative to the modern IDE? How have people managed without one? Or do we just have to except the fact that the IDE is something we can never get away from?"	11848278	RiderOfGiraffes	RiderOfGiraffes	151	1288375742	2010-10-29 18:09:02 UTC	292	How Do You Stop Sea Captains From Killing Their Passengers?	http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/09/09/129757852/pop-quiz-how-do-you-stop-sea-captains-from-killing-their-passengers		07606131	antr	antr	160	1397766854	2014-04-17 20:34:14 UTC	548	"Gabriel Garc��__a M��_��_rquez, Literary Pioneer, Dies at 87"	http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/books/gabriel-garcia-marquez-literary-pioneer-dies-at-87.html?_r=0&assetType=nyt_now&gwh=570AEB18E30D9E2DEB245EFDC150909D&gwt=regi&assetType=nyt_now		01666726	throwaway52	throwaway52	74	1283782894	2010-09-06 14:21:34 UTC	37	Ask HN: When are you allowed to quit a startup?		"Hi Everyone-- Long wall of text ahead, sorry, but hopefully details will help.<p>I've been working at a startup since the beginning of the year. It has been good thus far -- great environment, great people, great time. I'm the only programmer and our products absolutely require this company to have a programmer on staff. I'm very much enjoying the work -- this wasn't in my area of expertise before (the business end) but I'm really getting a knack for understanding how our product fits in the field. And further, I've been able to really develop my skills to be a versatile programmer/dev. ops. guy.<p>The problem is that I'm looking at the calendar, and listening to all the conversations about sales and what not, and thinking: \Man, this company is probably going to go belly up around Christmas.\"" And while in this part of the world, it wouldn't be too hard for a programmer to get work -- even freelance work until the post-Christmas doldrums -- I'd really not want to be out of work around Christmas. I have mega bills (student loans) and am very fastidious about money.<p>At this point, I'm trying to keep the whole thing very un-personal even though I'm really good friends with all of the founders (CEO/CFO/COO). But, I think it should be noted that as we launched one of our first products a few weeks back, all three founders took vacation the week/weekend before the launch -- it was assumed that I'd get the project done on time, so I ended up canceling mine. So, at the end of the day, I'm wondering if the Godfather quote comes into play -- \""This is business not personal.\""<p>Further -- the company is trying to figure out how to stay afloat, and one of the ideas is to start doing consulting. Which sounds fine, but I came from a consulting/agency background specifically to leave that type of work; so while I would gladly help these guys out if we were doing it while working on the core products, this new model where we give up the core products for five or six months is just not very appetizing.<p>I know there are other startups interested in me -- they've reached out to me -- but I'm just not sure what to do when the boat is sinking. I understand if I was a skin-in-the-game cofounder, then like a captain, its down with the ship. But what if I'm just one of the first employees, who still has no equity (that discussion was had and they decided I'd get a \""big\"" share, once we became revenue neutral) and who has enough bills and student loans to not be comfortable with the idea of one day paychecks just stop coming?<p>Thanks for any insight or personal experiences..."""	-1265937	dhotson	dhotson	100	1217820015	2008-08-04 03:20:15 UTC	37	Ask HN: What has been your biggest mistake?

Hi fellow Hackers! I am a grad student&#x2F;wannabe-enterprenuer&#x2F;hacker and I am really looking for advice in choosing a good work machine that would suit all three roles. Your advice is most welcome. I&#x27;ve been using company laptops and an old Dell Studio that worked well for last 7 years. Now I need one and the market is flooded with configurations and models. Maybe this discussion can help me and others in choosing something that is our livelihood :)	14989187	001sky	001sky	87	1356958534	2012-12-31 12:55:34 UTC	42	The Real Hazards of E-Devices on Planes	http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/f-a-a-rules-make-electronic-devices-on-planes-dangerous		0159500	raghus	raghus	114	1207797567	2008-04-10 03:19:27 UTC	42	Tell YC: Summer 08 decisions out		got a no :(	06486991	friism	friism	74	1380771237	2013-10-03 03:33:57 UTC	298	Lmctfy: Google's Linux application container stack	https://github.com/google/lmctfy/		04056310	mcrider	mcrider	77	1338591830	2012-06-01 23:03:50 UTC	298	Barack Obama Directs All Federal Agencies to Have an API	http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/		08587379	zactral	zactral	79	1415662804	2014-11-10 23:40:04 UTC	298	The dark side of .io	https://gigaom.com/2014/06/30/the-dark-side-of-io-how-the-u-k-is-making-web-domain-profits-from-a-shady-cold-war-land-deal/		08436659	ggurgone	ggurgone	114	1412926730	2014-10-10 07:38:50 UTC	298	CSS: It was twenty years ago today	https://dev.opera.com/articles/css-twenty-years-hakon/		06300923	aforarnold	aforarnold	210	1377856438	2013-08-30 09:53:58 UTC	298	Ask HN: How Can I leave Syria now and get asylum in Europe (Germany)		"Guys, I am in Syria(specifically in Damascus). Seems war is rolling out. Most of the people are moving to border regions but I cant and I am a programmer worked as a remote dev for an Australian startup. But I am not sure how long I will be able to work living in Syria. I want move to Europe specially in Germany as the startup scene is booming in Berlin. So can you guys give me suggestion of legal way to move in Germany as an asylum and will I be able to work if I can move. I went through google but couldn&#x27;t find much information. And I will be happy to have contact with startups that are hiring dev. I have couple of years backend development experience with Python(Django),LAMP,Node.js and some unix skill.

What do I do wrong?		"(using a throwaway account)<p>I'm in the middle of a very painful job search in London and here for help. My background is Java, I used it for 10 years in a very latency- and performance-critical environments, so I can say I'm very familiar with the nuts and bolts of language and the JVM. As any HN oldie, I know that just doing your job is not often enough, so in parallel I launched my own iPhone app (which as of today grew to 20 KLOC of C and Objective-C) that was covered by major news outlets and featured by Apple themselves in the Education category. I'm very proud of the work I've done. I can do Python (wrote a Twisted-based backend for collaborative app) and Haskell (when asked, can code on a whiteboard). I did Andrew Ng's course online last year. I REALLY can deliver.<p>At the moment, I work for a major bank in a position that drives me nuts. Everything about this job is wrong but most important is that I don't feel that I use my skills at all. I started my job hunt this spring, applied to all attractive companies I know of in London and pinged every available contact in my network.<p>The results were underwhelming. Google UK rejected me after an on-site interview. Twitter UK were hiring for a very relevant position but listed Scala as a requirement ��_��_��_ I wrote a small RE matcher in Scala in a few hours and sent the code and my resume directly to their engineering manager whose contact I got from my network. No reply. Facebook UK and Amazon UK didn't want to even do a screening interview with me. 90% of other companies didn't bother replying. As a net result I got one offer from a startup I liked but refused it because I didn't feel we're on the same wavelength with the founder who interviewed me.<p>I'm pretty desperate at this moment and feel that I'm doing something wrong. If you're running a cool software company, what do you think a senior guy from a major bank must write in his resume to stop you from shredding it on the spot? Thank you for any advice."	-18237336	sarciszewski	sarciszewski	110	1409236030	2014-08-28 14:27:10 UTC	44	Likely the most painful password hashing discussion you'll ever read	https://scott.arciszewski.me/misc/Linkedin/Fail.html		-18239129	mlinksva	mlinksva	269	1409253178	2014-08-28 19:12:58 UTC	300	Hal Finney being cryopreserved now	http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2014-August/082585.html		05157984	adambenayoun	adambenayoun	93	1359851763	2013-02-03 00:36:03 UTC	300	Creator Of The X-Plane Flight Simulator Seeks Help Fighting A Patent Troll	http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/02/creator-of-the-x-plane-flight-simulator-seeks-help-fighting-a-patent-troll/		14007599	jcubic	jcubic	100	1337692255	2012-05-22 13:10:55 UTC	300	"Man, stranded in the desert, makes a motorcycle from his broken car"	http://hackaday.com/2012/05/21/man-stranded-in-the-desert-makes-a-motorcycle-from-his-broken-car/		-15668324	sajid	sajid	101	1367937266	2013-05-07 14:34:26 UTC	300	Our Solar System Isn't Normal	http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/05/06/181613582/our-very-normal-solar-system-isn-t-normal-anymore		06513765	kamaal	kamaal	120	1381224182	2013-10-08 09:23:02 UTC	300	Bertrand Russell: In Praise of Idleness (1932)	http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html		07346454	aditgupta	aditgupta	194	1394020304	2014-03-05 11:51:44 UTC	300	Mathematicians are chronically lost and confused 	http://j2kun.svbtle.com/mathematicians-are-chronically-lost-and-confused		04834859	bsimpson	bsimpson	74	1353976582	2012-11-27 00:36:22 UTC	45	$49 Personal Genome at 23andme (incognito windows until you get the best price)	http://www.23andme.com/		14769885	dutchbrit	dutchbrit	77	1352652800	2012-11-11 16:53:20 UTC	45	"Offer HN: Tell me what you need, and I'll program it (for free)"		"To refresh my mind, I'm looking at taking on one small project.

"I just want to know if the following is pretty common thing in the gaming industry, being all new to the field I am not too sure. It would be nice to get feedback.<p>I recently applied for a junior software engineer position with Crytek(Germany).<p>As a first line of assessment they had given me a coding test to be completed within a week, the HR lady gets back to me after a day to tell me that I have only 2 days to complete it. No big deal, as I had already completed it the same day, I submit it.<p>Next after a couple of days, I was asked to attend an international telephonic interview with 4 senior programmers. Unfortunately for the interview, there were some technical problems from their side which resulted in a telephone call where I could hear their conversation but they could not hear me.<p>Shockingly, as they were trying to fix the problem for an hour without realizing that I could hear them, I overhead them making racial jokes&#x2F;taunts at me.<p>Without giving any further thought to what just had happened, I emailed the HR to request a re-schedule of the interview but I have still not received any reply. I am thinking they might have dropped my application for the fact that it maybe too much hard work for them to assess me.<p>what I would like to know from those of you who may have a lot of experience in the industry, is this something common, that one should expect when you interview in the gaming industry regardless of the company being an AAA games developer.<p>To be honest, I was shocked and appalled by the lack of professional courtesy."	07107735	thomholwerda	thomholwerda	70	1390480807	2014-01-23 12:40:07 UTC	47	Nokia posts disappointing Lumia sales	http://www.osnews.com/story/27534/Nokia_posts_disappointing_Lumia_sales		-15213338	kevinSuttle	kevinSuttle	71	1360767548	2013-02-13 14:59:08 UTC	47	To a Future Woman In Tech	http://futurewomanintech.com/		06770393	bachback	bachback	75	1384975185	2013-11-20 19:19:45 UTC	47	New Top-Level Domains	http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings		06505111	co_pl_te	co_pl_te	75	1381087419	2013-10-06 19:23:39 UTC	47	Apple Under Siege	http://www.mondaynote.com/2013/10/06/apple-under-siege/		0657119	niyazpk	niyazpk	77	1244990496	2009-06-14 14:41:36 UTC	47	Textbooks must die	http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/06/textbook-rant.html		-11710337	dustyreagan	dustyreagan	80	1285013409	2010-09-20 20:10:09 UTC	47	Ask HN: Are you saving for retirement?

"Dear HN,<p>My co-founder (who is a close friend) and I have been working on a startup for about 1 year now. My co-founder had the \idea\"" for a startup. He needed a programmer, so we joined forces. His role is supposed to be design (though currently the application uses my design) and sales/business development/marketing.<p>The product is 99% complete and could be launched in a week. Unfortunately, we can't agree on partnership terms and ownership of the company. My co-founder wants 60% of the company and refuses to split the equity equally with me. My attempts at discussing/negotiating this with my co-founder only stir hostile, belittling responses from him.<p>I've often felt bullied and mistreated by this person, who treats me like a \""resource\"" and bosses me around like a child. Though in certain stages of the project my co-founder has contributed significantly to mocking up the user-interface, we've gone through many iterations and, currently, 100% of the design AND code was created by me.<p>It's looking like we are about to go our separate ways, and my he is threatening legal action and asking me to sign an NDA.<p><i>He is not trying to take my work. He wants to start from scratch again by finding a co-founder or hiring a developer to build his idea.</i> The thing is, I'm still invested in my product. I don't want to ditch it.<p>I haven't signed anything up until now. I think my co-founder registered an LLC, but we've never agreed and signed any sort of partnership/ownership/nda agreement. What power do I have in this situation? Could I find a new non-technical co-founder and launch my product? As a last resort, I would even launch my product for free so my co-founder does not find another poor technical co-founder to abuse. I feel very cornered right now.<p>I've spent over 1200 hours designing and developing and have a very strong vision for the product.<p>What can I do?<p>Thanks in advance, HN. You guys are the best.<p><i></i>* ONE SUPER-IMPORTANT FACT I FORGOT TO MENTION <i></i>* My co-founder does not have access to my code. I've suspected a partnership breakdown for awhile now, and since I haven't signed anything legal, I decided to make sure all of my work stayed out of my co-founders hands. I've never signed any agreement. I haven't been paid a penny."""	-18711761	MichaelCrawford	MichaelCrawford	148	1417945411	2014-12-07 09:43:31 UTC	50	I Don't Agree That There Really Is a Tech Worker Shortage		"I know lots of engineers who are unable to find work.<p>I do believe the hiring managers who say they can&#x27;t find the workers they need.  What I don&#x27;t believe is that the workers aren&#x27;t out there, hoping to get hired.<p>I speculate that the reasons for the perceived - and ONLY perceived - shortage is that it&#x27;s far more difficult for employers and potential employees to find each other.  Another problem is that us engineers are expected to have real-world, paid experience in whatever technology the hiring company uses, rather than these companies providing on-the-job training.<p>At one time, a college degree and a demonstrable grasp of computing technology was all one needed.  Companies were happy to train.  No longer.<p>What really kills me is that when a new technology is introduced, one is _immediately_ required to know about it before getting a job where that technology will be used.  Consider that Swift, a new programming language that Apple hopes will make it easier to write iOS Apps, has only been available for a few months, yet one cannot get a job writing Swift code, unless one already has PAID Swift experience on one&#x27;s resume.

Advice?		"So, I've just inherited a very large, very badly written monstrosity. Including javascript, template files etc, it breaks the 1 million LOC barrier. I'm looking for some advice and strategies that you guys might have used in similar situations, in particular on:<p>- getting a handle on the code base - communicating 'progress' to the client - not losing the will to live<p>The software is based on vtiger, an open-source CRM that has a (deserved) reputation of being incredibly badly written, that has since been badly hacked apart by several different companies with wildly differing ideas. My client currently have 150+ installs and 150+ angry clients.<p>Words fail me trying to describe the state of the software.<p>- no niceties such as MVC, ORMs, a DBAL, or a modular design - all DB queries are inline SQL, with tens of inner joins on most queries - dizzying call stack, yet reams of copy+paste code<p>The best part: the code will often query the DB and execute PHP code contained in the response, or load and run arbitrary files and modules as dictated by parsing particular DB fields. The one page I have studied in detail generates 105 DB queries in the simple case.<p>The DB itself is even worse. There are over 600 tables, as well as views, custom functions, cascades and (but of course) triggers. There is no consistent naming schema, very few explicit foreign key references (despite being heavily, heavily entwined) and I have already discovered several tables that don��_�t have primary keys, but are referenced by exact string matches on things like date stamps.<p>I wont mention the table-based HTML, javascript, lack of version control etc.<p>I��_�m not sure if its even possible to give relevant advice (besides perhaps ��_��_��_run screaming��_�), but if anyone here has come through a similar situation and has any advice to share, I would be deeply grateful.<p>Help me HN - you're my only hope.

"There is no good place to ask this, since there are loyalists on both sides. I can only hope that Hacker News has enough sane-minded people who will answer this properly (if it gets upvoted enough to show up on the front-page, of course).<p>After watching the complete Google I/O keynote and WWDC '10 keynote, even I have to admit that Android (Froyo) has left iOS behind on features. Articles like [these][1] might say that Apple has given a solid reply, but I don't think they have. When I see features like Android's cloud-to-phone messaging APIs, I long for them to be in iOS. But then iOS 4 has nothing of this sort. Froyo also has APIs to make app data searchable, which iOS 4 doesn't for non-Apple apps. And these are just a few things that looking back at it now makes iOS 4 just seem so much weaker. Gingerbread will be out in October if I believe Engadget, and that will pull Android further away from iOS. People can talk about fragmentation ��_��_��_ which will become less of an issue with Gingerbread, and the fact that users don't care about such features.��_��_But developers do. If Apple falls behind on features that developers want, the App Store numbers they like to tout to loudly will stop growing so rapidly.<p>To be honest, as a user, iOS 4 adds nothing that truly stands out as \THIS is why I must have the iPhone\"" except for Facetime and the Retina Display. Being a long time Apple loyalist and enthusiast, it both worries and saddens me to see Apple so blatantly miss the boat. So my question is, has Apple dropped the ball after a solid start and fallen behind so much that the trickle of developers will slowly become a full flow which they won't be able to stop?<p>[1]: www.roughlydrafted.com/2010/06/08/apples-ios-wwdc-strikes-back-after-googles-android-io/"""	07387524	danvideo	danvideo	89	1394650635	2014-03-12 18:57:15 UTC	309	MMM Receives Legal Threats	http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2014/03/11/mmm-receives-legal-threats-great-lawyer-wanted/		02460233	amirkhella	amirkhella	90	1303153806	2011-04-18 19:10:06 UTC	309	Hacking The Status Game	http://blog.amirkhella.com/2011/04/18/the-status-game/		0896113	mtinkerhess	mtinkerhess	113	1256178912	2009-10-22 02:35:12 UTC	309	I Was Told I Was Very Smart	http://theferrett.livejournal.com/1346357.html		06929432	goblin89	goblin89	139	1387391155	2013-12-18 18:25:55 UTC	309	oDesk to merge with Elance	https://www.odesk.com/blog/2013/12/odeskelancemerge/		08206855	MarkMc	MarkMc	140	1408621825	2014-08-21 11:50:25 UTC	309	Show HN: A virtual whiteboard for working or teaching remotely	http://whiteboardfox.com/		06182690	mfincham	mfincham	146	1376004387	2013-08-08 23:26:27 UTC	309	Some killjoys have removed the blink tag from Firefox	http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/08/a-light-has-gone-out-on-the-web/		01556835	mattyb	mattyb	208	1280386515	2010-07-29 06:55:15 UTC	309	Everyone Who Tried to Convince Me to Use Vim Was Wrong	http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong		06159633	wikiburner	wikiburner	260	1375704847	2013-08-05 12:14:07 UTC	565	U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans	"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-dea-sod-20130805,0,5453047.story"		05549564	bcn	bcn	521	1365996117	2013-04-15 03:21:57 UTC	1333	Gitmo Is Killing Me	http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/15/opinion/hunger-striking-at-guantanamo-bay.html		07890449	ihnorton	ihnorton	70	1402688023	2014-06-13 19:33:43 UTC	54	Typed Lua: An Optional Type System for Lua [pdf]	http://www.lifl.fr/dyla14/papers/dyla14-4-typed-lua-an-optional-type-system.pdf		0460555	vaksel	vaksel	73	1233465266	2009-02-01 05:14:26 UTC	54	New owners of eBaum's World fire ebaum and his staff	http://blog.ebaum.tv/2009/01/welcome.html		068563	pg	pg	78	1192549158	2007-10-16 15:39:18 UTC	54	"'Second Earth' found, 20 light years away"	http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/apr/25/starsgalaxiesandplanets.spaceexploration		07066314	psibi	psibi	79	1389821481	2014-01-15 21:31:21 UTC	54	Please Don't Learn Category Theory (2013)	http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/posts/2013-10-14-please-dont-learn-cat-theory.html		06338631	callumjones	callumjones	79	1378441028	2013-09-06 04:17:08 UTC	54	Why the NBN needs to go the full way	http://callumj.com/post/60421062721/why-the-nbn-needs-go-the-full-way		02011805	ggordan	ggordan	80	1292502723	2010-12-16 12:32:03 UTC	54	Ask HN: Why is there so little innovation in education?

"Rather, do you think primarily in your native language, or more in terms of abstract imagery?<p>I've noticed that rather than forming images in my head to represent ideas, I will instead often <i>think in English</i>.  For example, if I'm working through a logic problem, I will repeat the various elements of the problem in my head <i>in English</i> repeatedly until I solve it.<p>I'm unfortunately unilingual.  English is the only human language I have ever learned.  I've noticed that when I speak phrases in Spanish, I'm actually speaking English in my head.  It's like a lookup table. By that I mean, let's say I want to communicate \How are you?\"".  Rather than attempting to reason through this task in Spanish (by trying to communicate the individual elements \""how\"", 'in what way', \""are\"", 'your state of being', and \""you\"" 'the person I am communicating with'), I try to remember the phrase in Spanish that corresponds to the ordered set of words \""How are you?\"".  So it is rote memorization -- I'm not thinking in Spanish, I'm translating from English to Spanish, speaking it, then hearing a response and translating that back into English.  No wonder I was never able to learn another language.  There's always this complicated layer of indirection.<p>Anyway, back to the topic: do you find that you think more in terms of words or of images?<p>Here's one reason I can't imagine thinking through a problem without reciting it to myself in English several times.  Let's say for example I need to describe the concept 'empathy', which is to say, understanding another person's situation by virtue of having been in a similar one yourself.  I'd imagine it would be very difficult to conjure up an image which succinctly describes empathy.  It seems like the verbal encoding \""empathy\"" is probably the most succinct way to describe it.  So why try to think in terms of images when our native languages are so very precise?<p>And yet, \""thinking in English\"" can be a burden.  I can feel how it limits me to thinking through problems in certain predefined ways, just as a given editor forces you to edit text in certain predefined ways.  I would imagine that most extremely creative people (such as DaVinci, Tesla, etc) probably don't have this limitation imposed on their neocortex.<p>More importantly, my reading speed is significantly degraded.  I tend to recite each sentence to myself as I read it.  I've been unable to find much information about how to break this limitation, so any references would be very appreciated.<p>Thoughts?"""	06538415	dannypovolotski	dannypovolotski	100	1381579191	2013-10-12 11:59:51 UTC	56	OS X Mavericks GM is out ��_��_��_ how to make a bootable installation USB	http://povolotski.me/2013/10/12/osx-mavericks-gm-out-bootable-installation-usb/	"The golden master for OSX Mavericks is out!

I always felt that I was not guided properly and even the professors themselves dont know anything in India.<p>My grades were horrible for two years and that was   like so demoralising that I lost my self confidence even nore. Being shy at college also did not help and even some good for nothing teachers gave me a hard time; I fell completely lonely, even the motivation which was from visiting HN and other sites is fading. Not even remember any single piece of achievement and appreciation in these two years and always feel like dropping out of college.  I now think I am going on right path but still college and the people phobia keeps haunting me. Never have I had a clear mind; the minute I start studying I get emotionally down by remembering any fscking embarrasing situation I had. I have never consulted my problem this deeply to anyone in college. The fact that I let go couple of years  that could had made me more confident in python programming is making me feel worse.

"It would be interesting to hear your specific financial goals, such as: \I would sell my startup if the net proceeds of the sale would exceed n.\""  I'm more interested, however, in knowing what factors you considered to come up with your number.<p>I am asking because I run a profitable internet business that has doubled each of the last three years; our metrics indicate that we can maintain that growth rate for the foreseeable future.  As with any business, there are major risks but the likelihood of them actually threatening us is relatively low; unfortunately, precisely quantifying the risks is impossible.<p>Since a significant chunk of my net worth is tied up in the business, I worry that a \""rogue wave\"" could endanger our prospects.  We have been approached multiple times by serious acquirers offering favorable terms and a 5x revenue multiple; so far, have I rejected their offers.  We have no outside investors so the decision to sell would be entirely mine.<p>Since the M&#38;A market is beginning to show signs of life again, I am considering a sale.  The question is, how does one decide when to step off the train, and take a huge amount of risk off of the table?

I like this community a lot and want to see if there's anything I can do to make you a little more successful. No strings. To give you an idea of what I might be able to help you with, let me tell you a few things I've done to help others...<p>- Last night, I volunteered at TEDxMIA's screening of TEDGlobal where I fulfilled their video stream management and multiplexing fantasies,<p>- I've built network operations center monitoring software for proprietary wireless protocols. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnleO8H4lyY)<p>- I regularly brainstorm with others in the SoFL entrepreneurial and tech circles as we look for ways to grow our community and attract talent to our market.<p>- I'm an early adopter, enjoy playing with new tech and can provide strong, constructive, specific feedback.<p>- I understand good design from bad design. Aesthetics are not lost on me.<p>- I have a family and juggle a mediocre work-life balance that's gradually improving.<p>So if there's something I can help you with, just ask here or @mikegreenberg on Twitter.

"As a developer I need to test code on multiple versions of Windows and for this I have 4 virtual machines running on a Lenovo W500/8GB/256GB laptop plugged into a 24\ monitor. For convenience I often have all four running concurrently. However with 8GB ram I often run out of memory and I'm low on disk space, hence my motivation to upgrade. I'm just about to purchase the new retina Macbook pro/16GB/512GB as it would appear a perfect fit as I could easily run all the VM's concurrently with room to spare and being on an SSD they would also be super-fast.<p>However I really value mobility especially around the house and the Macbook Air 13\""/8GB/256GB comes highly recommended by peers. I had an epiphany thinking that perhaps I could rent a dedicated server to relieve the memory and disk requirements. With an Intel i7-2600 Quad/16GB/6TB-raid1 from Hetzner.de (50 Euro p.m), I could host all my Windows desktop VM's and also a few Ubuntu server VM's and use remote desktop and SSH to access them respectively. I realize there will be some additional latency but that��_�s fine for what I need to use them for and I have a 60Mb/s fiber connection.<p>Has anyone else attempted something similar? Am I missing anything? My preliminary research points me to using Linux KVM as the host. Can I really forgo the weight/size of a Retina 15\"" (+- $3900 here in Europe) for the Macbook air ($2300) + a remote server. Obviously I would be sacrificing the Retina screen and the dedicated GPU but neither is important to me, especially as I spend half my time plugged into a 24\"" monitor + mechanical keyboard. Additionally I'm not concerned about the cost of a server as I already have many very underutilized servers at my disposal and so it wouldn't cost any extra. Any advice would extremely helpful.

A lot of the articles written out there seem to either be dated (so some of the qualms may have been changed in newer versions) or biased.  I have no experience in Python or Ruby, so I am completely open to either, I just want to make sure the investment in the time spent learning is worth it not just for this project but also for future ones (and for potential jobs).  I also am curious as to which hosting service you all use and how easy it is to implement that framework with it.  I had bought my domain name with GoDaddy.com along time ago, but I am open to switching to something reliable (and cheap I am still a student). Thanks for any input!<p>EDIT (To elaborate a little on my project, without giving details):<p>The project is relatively simple and provides a service to an area for a small fee.  For now, the area would be specific to one geographic location.  As the site grows and progresses, the site will need to scale by adding more locations (organized similar to how craiglist is specific to each location)."	09295606	gz5	gz5	121	1427803310	2015-03-31 12:01:50 UTC	70	Deflation	http://avc.com/2015/03/deflation/		01860823	KoZeN	KoZeN	153	1288712004	2010-11-02 15:33:24 UTC	70	Ask HN: How do I give my son a head start?

"I am an American programmer living in Southern California making around $100,000 USD per year. Pretty much your average experienced programmer salary, maybe even a little on the low side.<p>I have been applying for programming jobs in San Francisco and in Germany, the Netherlands, and other mainland European countries. I finally got an offer from a company in Austria but the salary was a lot lower than I was expecting, only 45,000 EUR (~$65,000 USD). This is even a \Senior\"" programmer position!<p>To put things in perspective, I also got an offer from a company in San Francisco that is a significant raise from my current salary, but that is to be expected given the current programming job market in SF.<p>I was expecting the pay to be worse in Europe, but not <i>that</i> worse. The company in Vienna insists that this is a fair salary for the region but I am finding this very hard to believe.<p>I'm not in this for the money at all, but I also don't want to sell myself short. Can anyone help me out with their experiences with programmer salary in mainland Europe?

As far as I can tell, two of our experiments are working.<p>The first is posting feedback in the threads about what&#x27;s good and bad for HN comments. Right now, dang is the only one doing this, but other moderators may in the future. We&#x27;ve learned some things about how to do it: 1) the feedback should be as neutral as possible; 2) it should be about the comment, not the commenter; and 3) where possible, it should say what would make the comment better.<p>Other HN users have been pitching in with feedback too, which is great! If you&#x27;d like to help, please do. Just try to follow the three guidelines above.<p>The second experiment is a change we made to the comment scoring and ranking algorithms. These algorithms do more than just counting and sorting because pg wrote a lot of code to address systemic issues as they came up over the years. But the community doesn&#x27;t stay static, so the algorithms shouldn&#x27;t either.<p>After studying the data, dang and kogir tuned the algorithms to make some downvotes more powerful. We&#x27;ve been monitoring the effects of this change, and it appears to be reducing toxic comments.<p>The majority of HN users are thoughtful and nice. It&#x27;s clear from the data that they reliably downvote jerks and trolls (and specifically, they don��_�t silence minority groups��_��_��_we��_�ve looked into this). What dang and kogir found was a way to turn the volume up on this kind of downvote. We believe this has made the comment scores and rankings better reflect the community.<p>We will be trying a lot more experiments. We&#x27;ll stop the ones that don&#x27;t work and continue the ones that do.<p>dang and kogir, great work so far.

"It's been a blockbuster year and I'm looking forward to 100K EUR in my checking account very soon.<p>How do I turn that into 1 million?<p>I'm a self-employed contractor, have been at it for over 10 years.<p>My strong point is learning complex things from scratch, on my own and quickly. I'm an autodidact and a college dropout. Judging by the amount of money I made from programming over the years, I'd say I'm a pretty good programmer. I'm driven by a quest for knowledge and I'm a voracious reader.<p>I'm quite tenacious and often seek perfection. I once rewrote a compiler from a trading language to C# in Haskell, OCaml and Lisp.<p>My weak point is that I get bored quickly, otherwise I would have developed an app and sold it already. My other weak point is that I love to work alone and hate lots of people around. Last but not least, I take a hedonist approach to programming and only take on projects that please me. I'm fine on the Mac, for example, and wouldn't go to Windows even if it made me money.<p>Trading is fun and interests me. I would also love to learn electronics, with an eye towards low-power gadgets on sailboats. I love sailing and will take August off to sail and get a RYA coastal skipper qualification. I'm also interested in robotics and embedded bits, although that's related to electronics.<p>I live in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) and would love to flip real estate but I'm afraid 100K won't carry me far. I'm married and have two daughters. I rent but paid cash for a recent BMW last year.<p>I'm thinking that trading may be my best bet. My first trade was back in 1996 when I was working at Bear Stearns and AOL announced unlimited dialup. I drew about 700 bucks from my credit card and bought two AOL calls (different months). My bet was that AOL will dominate the competition in the short term and I was up to over 2K in a month or so. Then AOL ran out of capacity and I was back to my 700 bucks after paying about 200 in commission to Bear.<p>I also bought 5K worth of APPL calls before Apple announced the iPhone. I had 12.5K less than two weeks later. Unfortunately, I rolled the profits into more calls to speculate on the following APPL earnings announcement. The iPhone bit was the big news, though, earnings did not matter and volatility dropped off. I got out with the same 5K I started with.<p>I tried small scale straddling and strangling (options) around earnings announcement but lost a bit of money. I also lost around 1.5K day-trading trading S&#38;P 500 and Russell 2000 e-mini futures.<p>I think there are plenty of opportunities for careful market speculation, particularly around events (BP oil spill?). I'm going through dozens of trading books and certainly won't repeat my amateur mistakes above.<p>I'm pretty content with what I have and use. I can't find a pressing need to develop something for myself and I can usually put up with my tools (Emacs, Erlang from the command-line).<p>I work alone at home and thus have a hard time spotting inefficient business processes. It was much better when I worked on Wall St, for example. I tried to launch a Securities Lending platform in 1997 but I guess I was way ahead of my time.<p>I also sold trading software full-time for a year, on a 30% commission. I found that existing trading software imposes the need to program on people who don't want it. Think making a non-programmer develop trading models in C#!<p>A wise friend, an experienced businessman, suggested that the only way to have a chance in hell to grow those 100k in to \bet on yourself\"" one way or the other.<p>Any other suggestions?<p>http://www.linkedin.com/in/joelreymont"""	08015459	luu	luu	182	1405008931	2014-07-10 16:15:31 UTC	84	Uber Makes Economists Sad	http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-07-09/uber-makes-economists-sad		08077038	nkurz	nkurz	109	1406150693	2014-07-23 21:24:53 UTC	340	Sierra Leone's chief Ebola doctor contracts the virus	http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/23/ozatp-uk-health-ebola-africa-idAFKBN0FS10V20140723		03760583	newobj	newobj	113	1332836980	2012-03-27 08:29:40 UTC	340	Turning down Zynga: Why I opted out of the $210M Omgpop buy	http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/167244/Turning_down_Zynga_Why_I_opted_out_of_the_210M_Omgpop_buy.php		07857457	Tomte	Tomte	138	1402057783	2014-06-06 12:29:43 UTC	340	A sealed bottle garden thriving after 40 years without fresh air or water	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2267504/The-sealed-bottle-garden-thriving-40-years-fresh-air-water.html		08262204	nreece	nreece	179	1409737657	2014-09-03 09:47:37 UTC	340	Logitech K480 ��_��_��_ Bluetooth Multi-Device Keyboard	http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/multi-device-keyboard-k480?crid=26		04982414	edent	edent	70	1356797048	2012-12-29 16:04:08 UTC	85	Why Facebook Makes Us Depressed 	http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/12/why-facebook-makes-me-feel-like-a-loser/		05335304	synparb	synparb	70	1362619123	2013-03-07 01:18:43 UTC	85	Authorea: Write research papers inside your browser	https://www.authorea.com/		08668568	jfaucett	jfaucett	70	1417117561	2014-11-27 19:46:01 UTC	85	Future of Programming Languages	http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FutureOfProgrammingLanguages		08185503	throwawaydotcpp	throwawaydotcpp	72	1408168598	2014-08-16 05:56:38 UTC	85	Ask HN: Experienced dev having career lull		"Hi folks, throwaway account obviously.<p>I&#x27;m a dev with a bit over 15 years experience. Right now I&#x27;m a senior dev working in &quot;cloud computing infrastructure&quot;. I&#x27;ve hit a point of malaise and I need help.<p>Admittedly, calling my problems problems is a disservice to real problems. I get that. But I hope you can empathize with the fact that anyone in any situation can become unhappy and want to feel happy and fulfilled again. So, hear me out.<p>I need change. I&#x27;m not burned out. I&#x27;m bored, maybe. Confused, perhaps?<p>Problem 1: My comp is high (total comp &gt; $200k last year), to the point where almost anywhere else I go will be a step down I feel. Having said that, I know if I randomly jump ship to another BigCo, I will keep that comp at least the same, and also pull down probably close to $100k in signing bonuses. So do I just bounce somewhere to pick up a pile of money?<p>Problem 2: My seniority is decreasing &quot;hands on keyboard&quot; time, which is what&#x27;s made me happy since I started programming in second grade. So I feel like my reward for accomplishment is to diminish what makes me happy. Some weird version of the Peter principle...<p>Problem 3: I literally have no idea what I want to work on. I&#x27;ve worked on lots of different things over the years, and I&#x27;m at the point where I look at the landscape out there - and it&#x27;s just &quot;meh&quot;. I don&#x27;t see much changing on a day to day basis from where I&#x27;m at now. Nothing is exciting me.<p>Problem 4: I don&#x27;t want to go into management, and I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding how to grow anymore as a developer.<p>Has anyone ever been here before?

Not only did I not recieve them, the transaction disappeared from my account, even though the ACH withdrawal had already clearly happened from my bank account.<p>Now, I&#x27;m still missing bitcoins in my account for transactions that have already been cleared and I&#x27;ve received a portion of the $10,701.03 in bitcoin at the price that I was was locked in at if I was to receive them on Friday, December 13th. I received them 5 days late and at the price locked in on December 8.<p>Coinbase is at fault and they&#x27;ve violated their own terms of service. I&#x27;ve asked for a similar resolution that the other gentleman on HN got from Brian, and this is the response I received from their customer support:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not sure how that guy got the CEO of the company to intercede on his behalf, but that&#x27;s definitely not a normal handling of that case.<p>I simply do not have the ability to do that, I&#x27;m sorry. None of the admins do. That guy must have been one of our extremely high volume VIP users or something in order for something like that to have happened.<p>I...don&#x27;t really know how to respond further. That does seem somewhat unfair. Very sorry, but I just don&#x27;t have the ability to push through such a request. Nor is it possible to forward a ticket to our CEO. My apologies, but I&#x27;m just not able to be of further help here...&quot;<p>What&#x27;s wrong with Coinbase right now? I&#x27;m a huge fan of them, but this is terrible customer service. I can&#x27;t get a fair resolution because your ticketing system doesn&#x27;t allow you to send a ticket to Brian or any of your other superiors? What kind of customer service is this?<p>I would even love an acknowledgment that Coinbase violated its TOS and is in the wrong here. I&#x27;m just looking for a fair resolution."	-14869640	MaxGabriel	MaxGabriel	70	1354597512	2012-12-04 05:05:12 UTC	88	Why 'The Daily' Failed	http://daringfireball.net/2012/12/why_the_daily_failed		09862135	brudgers	brudgers	73	1436498712	2015-07-10 03:25:12 UTC	88	A Garbage Collector for C and C++	http://www.hboehm.info/gc/		03943201	singular	singular	73	1336478703	2012-05-08 12:05:03 UTC	88	The Brittleness Of Type Hierarchies	http://www.codegrunt.co.uk/2012/05/08/Brittleness-Type-Hierarchies.html		09415793	klaythomp	klaythomp	74	1429639064	2015-04-21 17:57:44 UTC	88	The Python Road Not Taken	http://aleph.nu/blog/2015/the-python-road-not-taken/		07927578	Suor	Suor	76	1403437314	2014-06-22 11:41:54 UTC	88	Why Every Language Needs Its Underscore	http://hackflow.com/blog/2014/06/22/why-every-language-needs-its-underscore/		08555158	ekm2	ekm2	77	1415075731	2014-11-04 04:35:31 UTC	88	Stanford MBAs Shift Away from Tech	http://poetsandquants.com/2014/10/29/stanford-mbas-shift-away-from-tech/		03655931	LouDog	LouDog	78	1330678792	2012-03-02 08:59:52 UTC	88	Why Germany should copy Silicon Valley's culture rather than their startups	http://medien.nrw.de/apollo-m/2012/03/01/thanks-for-ignoring-them-homework-for-a-european-startup-ecosystem/		01058802	stakent	stakent	82	1263756776	2010-01-17 19:32:56 UTC	88	Google Agrees to Censor Encyclopedia Dramatica Entry in Australia	http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2010-01-17-n25.html		05783124	mh_	mh_	84	1369778294	2013-05-28 21:58:14 UTC	88	Younger Than The Xbox 360	http://www.marco.org/2013/05/28/younger-than-the-xbox-360		04321912	fmavituna	fmavituna	85	1343812874	2012-08-01 09:21:14 UTC	88	NSA Careers for DEF CON Attendees	http://www.nsa.gov/careers/dc20/		05215891	pjmlp	pjmlp	86	1360792094	2013-02-13 21:48:14 UTC	88	Several out of work as Valve makes 'large decisions' about its future	http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/186592/Several_out_of_work_as_Valve_makes_large_decisions_about_its_future.php#.URwJ8WckT8n		05697912	felipec	felipec	88	1368438688	2013-05-13 09:51:28 UTC	88	Another user/developer banned from GNOME's bugzilla without any warning	http://felipec.wordpress.com/2011/09/23/no-gnome-doesnt-want-user-feedback-how-i-argued-in-favor-of-voting-in-bugzilla-and-got-banned-as-a-result/		02007395	sahaj	sahaj	89	1292399202	2010-12-15 07:46:42 UTC	88	"Amazon Taking Down Erotica, Removing From Kindles"	http://theselfpublishingrevolution.blogspot.com/2010/12/amazon-in-book-banning-business.html		04049764	tnash	tnash	89	1338491127	2012-05-31 19:05:27 UTC	88	Windows 8 Release Preview ready for download	http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/iso?ocid=W_OFF_W8P_TechCenter_ISO_en-us		01074956	Padraig	Padraig	90	1264423665	2010-01-25 12:47:45 UTC	88	Ask HN: A competitor stole my iPhone app content ��_��_��_ what should I do?	http://padraig.tumblr.com/post/352537653/philip-kirwan-ripped-off-my-iphone-app-content		-13846019	gamebit07	gamebit07	104	1334553593	2012-04-16 05:19:53 UTC	88	Sergey Brin: Facebook and Apple a threat to Internet freedom	http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57414316-93/googles-sergey-brin-facebook-and-apple-a-threat-to-internet-freedom/		-14643892	rohshall	rohshall	109	1350018642	2012-10-12 05:10:42 UTC	88	Why is Linux more popular than BSD?	http://serverfault.com/questions/36359/why-is-linux-more-popular-than-bsd		04145791	irfan	irfan	118	1340348728	2012-06-22 07:05:28 UTC	88	Eric Schmidt's thoughts about Pakistan	https://plus.google.com/u/0/104233435224873922474/posts/4UcNomnhipX		07357644	keammo1	keammo1	120	1394152817	2014-03-07 00:40:17 UTC	88	Man Denies He's Bitcoin Founder	http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_BITCOIN_FOUNDER_DENIAL?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2014-03-06-19-35-06		02225110	mjfern	mjfern	122	1297833042	2011-02-16 05:10:42 UTC	88	Watson crushes the competition in second round of 'Jeopardy'	http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_tv_man_vs_machine		09851505	ingve	ingve	212	1436363689	2015-07-08 13:54:49 UTC	88	Some Functional Programmers Are Arrogant	http://www.devjoy.com/2015/07/some-functional-programmers-are-arrogant/		01058359	chaosmachine	chaosmachine	70	1263729084	2010-01-17 11:51:24 UTC	344	Need to refresh your math skills?

Is this a byproduct of our evolving hardware where instead of clock speeds the focus has been on pushing out more cores, so to reap the benefits software developers need better abstractions to make their code easily parallelizable? Is there some erlang-esque promise of pervasive immutability which is vaulting these languages into more popularity? Or is it simply the fact that these newer programming languages have simply learned from other languages&#x27; paint points and amplified the good parts by bundling them together neatly? I don&#x27;t have anything against these languages, I&#x27;m just trying to get a deeper understanding of what appears to be a trend in the programming language space."	01815636	pietrofmaggi	pietrofmaggi	93	1287672786	2010-10-21 14:53:06 UTC	101	"Why Apple saddled the MacBook Air with \gimped\"" CPUs"""	http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/10/why-apple-saddled-the-macbook-air-with-gimped-cpus.ars		02803970	dean	dean	100	1311619457	2011-07-25 18:44:17 UTC	101	Angry Birds Maker Sued for Patent Violation	http://mashable.com/2011/07/25/angry-birds-lawsuit/?WT.mc_id=obinsite		02603684	jtaby	jtaby	107	1306864964	2011-05-31 18:02:44 UTC	101	Google Chrome ��_��_��_ Why I Hate It And Continue To Use It	http://jtaby.com/2011/05/31/google-chrome-why-i-hate-it-and-continue-to-use-it.html		03409171	ColinWright	ColinWright	112	1325280656	2011-12-30 21:30:56 UTC	101	Why do C++ folks make things so complicated?	http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/06/14/why-do-c-folks-make-things-so-complicated/		-12502103	stephth	stephth	116	1304215000	2011-05-01 01:56:40 UTC	101	Objective-C's niche: why it survives in a world of alternatives	http://www.cocoawithlove.com/2009/10/objective-c-niche-why-it-survives-in.html		08369744	ilamont	ilamont	120	1411679222	2014-09-25 21:07:02 UTC	101	"FBI blasts Apple, Google for locking police out of phones"	http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/fbi-blasts-apple-google-for-locking-police-out-of-phones/2014/09/25/68c4e08e-4344-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html		07809791	chrismorgan	chrismorgan	157	1401284168	2014-05-28 13:36:08 UTC	101	Is Rust web yet?

My desktop PC, for instance. It's a great 6 months old working computer, with 8 cores and 16GB of RAM. \This ought to be enough for all my needs\"", I thought. The Bill Gates in me was right so far, but unfortunately this won't be enough for long.<p>Yesterday I took a look at my memory usage, out of curiosity: 11.4GB. Woah. I had a look at the breakdown.<p><pre><code>  - Chrome : ~3GB   - Firefox : ~1.5GB   - Java (eclipse) : ~1.2GB   - Rest in tons of various work-related apps. </code></pre> I'm of course responsible for letting this accumulate over several days, but still, a third of my RAM taken up by web browsing tabs? Chrome on its own clogging more than twice as much as Eclipse?<p>What worries me now is how hard we are getting struck with RAM-hogging web pages. Since I began writing this post, my freshly restarted Chrome browser with 9 open tabs (Hacker News (x2), Coding Horror, Google Search for \""Mac osX Lion review 6 months\"", MoPub Ad Service monitoring, Google Analytics Visitors Overview, Android Developer Console, Twitter, Gmail) is taking up roughly 500MB of RAM. That's insane. On my 2010 Macbook Pro with 4GB of RAM, this means 20% of my overall caching capacity is taken up by my core web needs. Needless to say, I can't use my macbook anymore.<p>Last summer I was working on a little java experiment - a cross-platform 3D labyrinth. I wanted the overall memory and data footprint to be as low as possible so it could be played on a low-end android phone with really fast loading, and yet to keep the game space as big as I could, so I designed my own dedicated data structures overnight. I made the following calculation: over 500MB of raw, uncompressed data, I could store the description of an area roughly equivalent to a map of Europe with a resolution of 2.5 meters per pixel.<p>I'm not claiming any feat here, just stating the obvious: web programmers are doing something that's definitely not cool for our current RAM budget. We forgot any sense of measure. It's unnecessary for a twitter feed following 175 persons for an hour or so to claim a 70MB RAM footprint. You're not the only nor the worst offender, Twitter. Except that I had 26 new tweets to display, I clicked, and the footprint suddenly grew to 76MB. 26 tweets = 6MB. We're talking about 140 characters tweets, let's be generous and multiply that amount by 100 to take into account the tweeter's profile (which are all 10,000 characters essays as we all know), and we get a total of 364 000 new characters, which end up claiming more than 6 million bytes in RAM. Which means the RAM impact of adding 26 new tweets to a webpage is at very very least 10 times higher than it could be, and probably more like a thousand times too high.<p>Like I said, I'm only using Twitter to state a point. I mean nothing wrong with Twitter's web devs - actually I'm myself a very poor web developer - and I'm pretty sure the blame could also be put on Google Chrome instead, but I remember a day in 2002 where my Internet Explorer was trying to load a 4MB webpage from the hard drive, causing a RAM footprint above 40MB and a failure after 20 minutes of waiting in front of a white screen. Back then I was merely a junior consultant working on QA, and I was the one to tell the devs that they were definitely doing something <i>not cool at all</i> for the user's computer. True, we were showing rather complex and impressive amounts of \""data\"" on our webapp with much simpler but oh so wrongly implemented \""UI\"" (in that case, hundreds of unnecessary nested table anchors), but I can't help thinking back at those times where it was simply impossible to make a product that was <i>not cool</i> for the user's computer, because the computer would refuse to run it at all. We're way past this line today. My Twitter's tab has now garbage collected some data. It's back to 73MB ram footprint. There are 32 new tweets to show. I click them, and the footprint bumps back up to 78MB. Meanwhile, my overall Chrome footprint is now showing 550MB private memory. That's 50MB for two clicks on Twitter and ~4500 characters in a HackerNews' submit form.<p>Moore's Law nowadays affects the computing power requirements of software rather than the computing performance of hardware, and this is killing us."""	05204011	brudgers	brudgers	90	1360624094	2013-02-11 23:08:14 UTC	102	Hey disaster novelists: Remember bicycles	http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/008895.html		-11616154	zackattack	zackattack	94	1282180090	2010-08-19 01:08:10 UTC	102	 Review my site: AwesomenessReminders	http://www.awesomenessreminders.com/		16611696	antr	antr	298	1382710442	2013-10-25 14:14:02 UTC	358	"In Almost Every European Country, Bikes Are Outselling New Cars"	http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/10/24/240493422/in-most-every-european-country-bikes-are-outselling-cars		08270951	jadlimcaco	jadlimcaco	201	1409868502	2014-09-04 22:08:22 UTC	358	Show HN: Famous Outfits	http://famousoutfits.com/		02337093	anateus	anateus	134	1300383733	2011-03-17 17:42:13 UTC	614	Subject: Airbnb	http://paulgraham.com/airbnb.html		03816385	steeleduncan	steeleduncan	70	1333966654	2012-04-09 10:17:34 UTC	103	Why I prefer scheme to Haskell	http://slidetocode.com/2012/04/09/why-i-prefer-scheme-to-haskell/		05744558	awaxman11	awaxman11	80	1369152089	2013-05-21 16:01:29 UTC	103	Show HN: My new homepage	http://awaxman.com		05318192	kschrader	kschrader	89	1362405812	2013-03-04 14:03:32 UTC	103	One day offices will be a thing of the past	http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/blog/one-day-offices-will-be-a-thing-of-the-past		06701517	r721	r721	90	1384002252	2013-11-09 13:04:12 UTC	103	S.F. programmers build alternative to HealthCare.gov [video]	http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57611592/s.f-programmers-build-alternative-to-healthcare.gov/		03783658	whoishiring	whoishiring	93	1333288072	2012-04-01 13:47:52 UTC	103	Ask HN: Freelancer?

"While thinking of ever more imaginative ways to punish domain squatters following yet another abandoned hunt for a domain-cum-product name, I finally became aware of the irony that I am sitting on a few decent domain names that I'm not using.<p>Then, I wondered, if one of the parked domains I've come across recently is held just by someone like me, not maliciously or out for profit, but just as a by-product of a non-startup startup, an abandoned weekend hackery project or whatever really.<p>So, rather than set up www.domainnameswap.com (partly because the name is parked ;o) ), how about a thread where we have a rummage down the back of the sofa and throw in any parked domains we'd be willing to give/swap away. If there's a match up, the relevant poster is contactable via their HN profile.<p>[Note: this idea may tank, but it's got to be worth a try.

"I got $100k in AWS Credits, with a 1-year time limit. I built a scrapy-powered image crawler that crawls over 300 art sites and finds the most popular posts with clustering algorithms and perceptual hashing (www.arthunted.com), but in the end it takes at most a few hours of a high CPU-instance per day to scrape and process (at most several dollars per day). At a year it&#x27;d barely make a dent.<p>I&#x27;m looking to build something that would make a splash, that would otherwise be constrained by budget, and that would have long-term self-sustaining value after the $100k runs out.<p>So no arbitrage, reselling, bitcoin mining, etc.<p>What type of project would require high-storage or high-amounts of processing? What can I build that would only be possible with that much money in infrastructure or compute power?

"Yesterday I was surprised to find myself trying Yahoo search because I couldn't get satisfactory search results in Google. It was the first time in years. I started thinking about this, and I realized that in the past few months I haven't been getting particularly good results from Google. I don't get spam or anything, but a lot of times I don't get useful results.<p>The thing is, I'm not sure if it's because I do a lot of very specialized stuff these days, or because the search quality really has gone down. Consider these two examples:<p>Search for \Linux asynchronous IO\"". You'll get a lot of articles, but most are four years old (which is an eternity in the Linux world). These results aren't very good - posix AIO is implemented in userspace threads, and io_submit and friends don't work in many cases. Which cases? Hard to tell - I couldn't find any information in the results no matter how long I searched. I couldn't find any benchmarks either.<p>Perhaps it's because there is no good info on this on the web (hard to believe). So let's try something else - search for \""concurrent hashmap in C\"". After hours of searching and playing with keywords, I got almost no useful results (other than Intel's libs, but not too much info on that either).

employed.<p>I worked in a consulting company in my country of origin and I was bootstrapping a startup in the meanwhile. A few weeks ago I moved to another job in another country. Now I have to close my startup because my employer does not allow it.<p>There are posts like this one http://blog.asmartbear.com/working-startup.html that tell you that usually things go well in this regard. While I don't doubt it, it wasn't my case. If you want to start a startup while employed, be very careful on this matter.<p>Actually everything seemed ok with this at first. I was hired in my current position because of my startup (I have an iPhone developer position here and the only iPhone development I ever made was in my startup) and during the interview I was asked if I wanted to continue to keep my startup after switching job. I answered yes to that question and there wasn't any issue about it.<p>I received my contract just a few days before leaving my country and there was a non competitive clause on it. Nothing strange, only a clause stating I can't compete with my employer while I am employed and I was in no way competing. So everything looked fine to me.<p>But when I got here I discovered that I'm not allowed to do any development out of the company, for myself or for anyone else, in any form (paid or free, open source or not), even if it is not competing in any way with this company. This is because they think that this would take my focus from my current job and since they give me a good salary and enough interesting challenges in my job, I don't need anything else (these are exactly their words).<p>I think this is very stupid and inconsistent. Stupid because I can just find any other passion that can take my focus from my job, or just get drunk every night (they actually encourage parties and drinking!). Inconsistent because they hire people that did extra projects out of their previous jobs. Then, when you are here, they forbid it. I think that as hackers you can imagine all the other flaws in this way of thinking and why it actually hurts all their company (which is mainly made of developers).<p>Let me tell you that it really hurts to close a startup and to give up all your work not because it failed but just because someone compels you to do so. Not because I was getting some big money from it (actually I still had to break even) but just because I did it for passion. I share the fault because I didn't ask to make everything clear before coming here, but given the premises everything seemed ok to me and I really wanted to leave my country so I overlooked this matter.<p>Actually I'm not in the position to challenge this decision and I can't just switch to another job, so for now I have to suck it and stop everything. As soon as I will be in a better position I will start looking for a job with better conditions for me (actually this is a very good job, but I really can't stand this stupid rule that controls what I can do with my spare time).<p>I just wanted to warn you. I hope that this will be useful for somebody."	02177076	ohashi	ohashi	177	1296769884	2011-02-03 21:51:24 UTC	116	Matt Cutt's thoughts on Google Bing Debate	http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/google-bing/		01998141	jonsteinberg	jonsteinberg	178	1292190334	2010-12-12 21:45:34 UTC	116	10% unemployment yet every startup in NYC struggling to hire	http://jonsteinberg.com/15-unemployment-yet-every-startup-in-nyc-is-s		-1908513	pg	pg	181	1256757628	2009-10-28 19:20:28 UTC	116	Announcement: YC alumni will help us read applications 		"We've recruited some YC alumni to help us read applications, starting with this cycle.  They've agreed to (a) stop reading any application that seems like it will compete with something their startup is doing or plans to, and (b) keep stuff in                   applications confidential.<p>These are people we know and trust, so we doubt there will be any problems.  But since we didn't tell people about this before they  applied (we are in fact still organizing it), we're giving anyone who wants to the opportunity to unapply.  If you want to have your application deleted, just email me (pg@ycombinator.com).<p>Also, in case anyone didn't know, the deadline for applying is  tonight at 10 Pacific.<p>Make sure you actually submit your application, using the  submit or resubmit button on http://news.ycombinator.com/apply, or we won't consider it.  (If you don't see a submit/resubmit button on that page, it's been submitted.)  Every cycle a few people          who probably meant to apply forget to actually submit their application after editing it.<p>Edit: Since a lot of people seem to be worried about this, the alumni are reading the applications in addition to us, not instead of us.  Our goal is to ensure that we don't overlook promising applications.  If we give an application a low rating but it gets high marks from alumni, we'll give it a second look."	07803388	sidcool	sidcool	117	1401177147	2014-05-27 07:52:27 UTC	372	A Hacker��_�s Guide to Git	http://wildlyinaccurate.com/a-hackers-guide-to-git		04185757	dalton	dalton	122	1341169231	2012-07-01 19:00:31 UTC	372	What Twitter could have been	http://daltoncaldwell.com/what-twitter-could-have-been		010254187	_sentient	_sentient	164	1442860045	2015-09-21 18:27:25 UTC	372	Unit Economics	http://blog.samaltman.com/unit-economics		05382786	calbucci	calbucci	231	1363379013	2013-03-15 20:23:33 UTC	372	Google is about to learn a tough lesson	http://blog.calbucci.com/2013/03/google-is-about-to-learn-tough-lesson.html		-110297882	fumar	fumar	251	1443547824	2015-09-29 17:30:24 UTC	372	New Chromecast 2015	https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_2015		01446612	aycangulez	aycangulez	73	1277048154	2010-06-20 15:35:54 UTC	117	How to destroy the Earth (completely)	http://qntm.org/destroy		-18352948	karavelov	karavelov	79	1411423758	2014-09-22 22:09:18 UTC	117	InfiniDB goes out of business	http://www.infinidb.co/forum/important-announcement-infinidb		04745544	lnguyen	lnguyen	82	1352146482	2012-11-05 20:14:42 UTC	117	Federal judge tosses Apple patent lawsuit against Motorola	http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57545283-37/federal-judge-tosses-apple-patent-lawsuit-against-motorola/		-19684223	comex	comex	83	1433827981	2015-06-09 05:33:01 UTC	117	"Bitcode (iOS, watchOS)"	https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH35-SW2		08060628	ValentineC	ValentineC	85	1405872196	2014-07-20 16:03:16 UTC	117	The voodoo of lobster economics	http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/my-travels-with-larry/article19557387/		04000931	justhw	justhw	88	1337565742	2012-05-21 02:02:22 UTC	117	Thiel on 60 minutes	http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7409142n&tag=contentBody;storyMediaBox		08939328	sysk	sysk	94	1422096649	2015-01-24 10:50:49 UTC	117	"Ask HN: All of you working with Big Data, what is your Data?"

I am using Java&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;R on a daily basis, but these are mature languages that have been around for a while and I have a hard time learning new frameworks that are beyond my work scope.<p>So what (hot) languages&#x2F;frameworks are you learnin&#x2F;using now, that give you the warm feeling that you get a lot of useful knowledge out of them, that&#x27;s widely applicable?"	03361322	jsnk	jsnk	141	1324056517	2011-12-16 17:28:37 UTC	122	Why don't they implement Python and Ruby on the web browsers?	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3722334/why-dont-they-implement-python-and-ruby-on-the-web-browsers		02280671	frsandstone	frsandstone	154	1299092073	2011-03-02 18:54:33 UTC	122	IPad 2 Official Specs	http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/		05897834	bra-ket	bra-ket	169	1371535827	2013-06-18 06:10:27 UTC	122	Prominent Scientists Sign Declaration that Animals have Conscious Awareness	http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/dvorsky201208251		09057493	emmatessler	emmatessler	188	1424102931	2015-02-16 16:08:51 UTC	122	"An Investor Wanted to Give Me $50,000.

"At school we often had to draw class diagrams, basically boxes containing some text, with arrows pointing to other boxes. The free tool we were using for this was made with Java, and would often be very buggy and was generally hated. I couldn't really find anything I liked and ended up making the diagrams in Gimp, not fun. I was really pining for a small perhaps Flash-based web tool that would let me make diagrams and download as PDF."	18709381	soundsop	soundsop	131	1417880696	2014-12-06 15:44:56 UTC	379	The World's Dumbest Idea: Maximizing Shareholder Value [pdf]	https://www.gmo.com/America/CMSAttachmentDownload.aspx?target=JUBRxi51IIBoe1yul9uERnfCmQoglFl9k5qwJSfHx8w%2fWCnFLmEb2MC9GoFnZVlslR5NzCRY1ajgn503icBv67VQg%2fNVUMWsYvi3A2%2fL%2bS28A7Pthjp7LmOfLYQfHMJc		06659583	pauloortins	pauloortins	302	1383408026	2013-11-02 16:00:26 UTC	124	An analysis of the C#/.NET platform	http://pauloortins.com/diving-into-csharp-dotnet-ecosystem/		06818416	pvorb	pvorb	71	1385713612	2013-11-29 08:26:52 UTC	124	Ask HN: Open Source alternatives to Disqus?

This is basically a to-do list or for future reference. - Both sidebars may be filtered by attributes or labels. - The \""list\""-icon, next to the filter in the left sidebar, gives you the classic gmail list in the center-panel.<p>Some technical background:<p>- It's build with Rails and PostgreSQL. - E-Mail sending/receiving is based on the MailGun infrastructure. - Turbolinks (https://github.com/rails/turbolinks) and Memcache for a speedy UX. - All mail data is saved in a multi-tenant PostgreSQL db and for backup purposes in a IMAP mailbox on MailGun. - Hosted on heroku.<p>I'm quite happy with the app by now and only go back to Gmail for older emails.<p>So my BIG QUESTION right now: Would you even consider using the app, in case I'd make a commercial product out of it? Would you pay for it?<p>Searching HN yielded that quite a few people are looking each month to leave Gmail (for various reasons), but of course there are quite a few gotchas with my approach, especially considering trust-issues.<p>Let me hear what you think."""	03444988	wallflower	wallflower	122	1326154368	2012-01-10 00:12:48 UTC	127	"Go East, Young Man"	http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/opinion/china-as-a-destination-for-job-seekers.html?_r=1		02453174	solarmist	solarmist	136	1302928105	2011-04-16 04:28:25 UTC	127	If average salaries are 80-100k why does everyone keep getting 40-60k offers?		"Are people's salaries really as high the numbers people are throwing around here? Around 80-100k for an average salary? My experience has been quite different. Is this just in big tech centers like SF, Seattle and NYC? Mainly consultant salaries? The people I know graduating with masters degrees from regional universities are getting 60k offers with undergrads getting 40-50k offers.<p>A little background for myself:<p>I've had a couple jobs. First was a student sys admin at U of MN computer science dept at about $10/hour (I think). Then in the Army where I made around $30k by the time I got out.<p>My next job in the industry was a relatively small company in the Portland area and there I made about $47k when I left and all new grads/entry level people were being offered $40k, no exceptions. The people there that had 5-10 years of experience were only making in the $65k range. And the senior developer/general manager was only making about $100k.<p>When I was offered the job I asked for $55k which I thought was really pushing it for only having some experience developing stuff in the army and in my classes.<p>So, what gives? What's with the Buick sized disconnect between my experiences and what I hear being discussed here on HN? Is there really a 40k difference in salaries just based on location?<p>All in all I consider myself a very good programmer (Honestly I'd guess in the top 80% of programmers, I haven't met one that's better than myself, but I don't consider myself nearly as experienced as a lot of the people here) that's passionate about coding and I've been doing it since I was in middle school, so I really want to be able to value myself accurately, but something just feels off about it. Looking at everything going on I'm thinking of leaving grad school if I can get offers like this?<p>Am I just marketing myself wrong? Any feedback would be appreciated.<p>You can check me out at github.com/solarmist or http://www.linkedin.com/pub/joshua-olson/5/521/88b."	07903720	mazsa	mazsa	140	1403003825	2014-06-17 11:17:05 UTC	127	JavaScript Cryptography Considered Harmful	http://matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/		01580144	organicgrant	organicgrant	202	1281067412	2010-08-06 04:03:32 UTC	127	"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars (2009)"	http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/science/earth/12suburb.html?_r=2&em		07813396	ismavis	ismavis	232	1401316457	2014-05-28 22:34:17 UTC	127	Getting to work on diversity at Google	http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html		09007308	_pius	_pius	70	1423186536	2015-02-06 01:35:36 UTC	128	One-electron universe	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_universe		02025354	felixge	felixge	70	1292872052	2010-12-20 19:07:32 UTC	128	Realtime encoding -

"	Hi HN, I am a developer in my 30s with over a decade of experience. Being on a lookout for a new job, I have been researching lots of jobs lately (since I don&#x27;t mind moving, been looking in most parts of the US). I am divided at the moment between finding a startup job or finding a rather drab big corp job with good money.<p>I noticed some rather unsettling job adverts in the past while. Some pre series-A startups in the valley offering like $90k in salary for an experienced developer and 0.05% equity. I am just trying to understand who are their target candidates that they expect to join for such an offer (not to mention crazy working hours)?<p>I have a small family with SO not working. So, I&#x27;d be at best manage to make ends meet at that kinda salary in SF, plus the equity is negligible, and the work hours... seriously, am I missing something here? Who would take these deals? And then I often find popular posts on HN where founders are giving out about how tough it is to get good engineers!"	-15812807	drucken	drucken	138	1370262583	2013-06-03 12:29:43 UTC	133	Why does

We have no funding except what we can afford to do ourselves, no investors and very little spare hardware.<p>Our site is a search engine - like google, but for flash content.  We threw together the site in a weekend and have been slowly tweaking it over time but recently have run into some growth issues.  If you have funding or investors and have growth issues, you can just throw more hardware at the problem and ta-da!  You're fast again.  However, for those of us who don't have money being thrown at us, we have to be a little more creative and start to look at optimization.<p>I've got a couple of old machines and an 8-drive SCSI RAID in my basement that I'm using for our search engine to crawl the web and process the data that we index for our search engine.  My machines are not quad-core and don't have 64GB of ram in them.  They're old and tiny.<p>When we first put http://mediawombat.com together, we threw it all together just to get it to work.  We did everything as quick and dirty as we could.  We used perl and mysql for the back-end.  The crawler was straight-forward, single-threaded, slow, clunky, but it worked.  After about 4 months of collecting data, we started to see some growth issues.  Searches were becoming slow.<p>We were using a live search through all of our indexed data.  First step to optimization - caching of course.  This was a pretty easy no-brainer.  We recorded all of the searches that people did on our site and we pre-cached the search results for the top-2000 of the most-popular searches.  This way, when someone does a search for a popular search phrase, they get (almost) immediate results.  Not too bad of a solution.<p>Just a few weeks ago, I noticed that our crawler has become the slowest part of our back-end process.  We had crawled most of our initial sites and gotten some good data back, but now, the crawler is just crawling lots of uninteresting urls and not getting anything of any value back.  We overflowed onto other sites with no flash and were now crawling sites that didn't return any useful data back.  We were wasting resources.<p>So, I was at my mother-in-law's place last weekend and she doesn't have any internet connectivity.  I was bored and needed some time away from the family to geek-out.  I thought to myself how I could make the back-end crawler and database more optimized ...  I re-wrote the crawler in C and made it multi-threadded.  And instead of reading and writing to a database, I used flat files.  I also pre-processed everything outside of the database using the old-style unix text utilities (grep, sort, uniq, sed, awk, ...).  One of those cartoonish lightbulb-over-the-head moments happened to me.<p>The unix text utilities were written in the 60's and 70's when computers were 33mhz and had 5MB of ram.  Of course these utilities are going to be lean and mean!  Perl was a memory hog and if I multi-threadded it, ate up most of my available ram on my machine if I spawned &#62; 5 threads.<p>I read the man pages on all of the unix text utils that I could find.  I even found some new ones that I didn't even know about before (and I've been using unix (linux) as my primary OS since 1990).  I managed to replace about 90% of my crawler that was previously written in perl, to a bunch of unix utilities, a few shell scripts and my multi-threadded crawler in C.  I did my crawling operations in bulk and processed them in the background while the crawler was doing it's thing.<p>I was super-proud that I had optimized the code as much as I had.  I went from about 30k urls a day to about 60k urls crawled an hour!  To me, that was a huge speedup!  Anyway, to make a long story short, I'm still looking for ways to optimize things and I've got a long list of things to do if/when the time becomes available and I've got more time than money at this point so it's worth the effort, and it's really rewarding!"	010263075	brendannee	brendannee	121	1442976643	2015-09-23 02:50:43 UTC	140	Uber shakes up real estate market with massive lease in Oakland	http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2015/09/exclusive-uber-oakland-sears-building.html		-15660860	cramforce	cramforce	131	1367813686	2013-05-06 04:14:46 UTC	140	Rent-a-coder hilarity (2008)	http://blog.willbenton.com/2008/11/rent-a-coder-hilarity/		12372428	mayukh	mayukh	139	1301156101	2011-03-26 16:15:01 UTC	140	Friends don't let friends get into finance	http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/26/friends-don%E2%80%99t-let-friends-get-into-finance/		15618035	xSwag	xSwag	153	1367076685	2013-04-27 15:31:25 UTC	140	How to eat healthily on ��_1 a day	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22263706		07850613	galapago	galapago	155	1401952144	2014-06-05 07:09:04 UTC	140	"HipHop: A \Popcorn Time\"" for music"""	http://gethiphop.net/		05840779	dshankar	dshankar	166	1370630284	2013-06-07 18:38:04 UTC	140	Obama��_�s Remarks on NSA Controversy	http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/06/07/transcript-what-obama-said-on-nsa-controversy/?mod=e2tw		010309249	fisherjeff	fisherjeff	173	1443674003	2015-10-01 04:33:23 UTC	140	Study: people who eat and exercise the same as people 20 years ago are fatter	http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/09/why-it-was-easier-to-be-skinny-in-the-1980s/407974/?single_page=true		03297091	ryanwhitney	ryanwhitney	234	1322690466	2011-11-30 22:01:06 UTC	652	Amit Gupta hasn't found a marrow transplant match; today's your last chance.	http://www.amitguptaneedsyou.com		07645044	downandout	downandout	70	1398408020	2014-04-25 06:40:20 UTC	141	RadiumOne CEO escapes felony charges	http://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/item/36623-radiumone-ceo-escapes/		-13211554	evanw	evanw	74	1320771685	2011-11-08 17:01:25 UTC	141	Firefox 8.0 is Released	https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/8.0/releasenotes/		06404326	neilpeel	neilpeel	77	1379496111	2013-09-18 09:21:51 UTC	141	Just go home	https://medium.com/life-hacks/76632b62eb0b		08052346	MozMorris	MozMorris	77	1405678078	2014-07-18 10:07:58 UTC	141	"Devicons, an iconic font made for developers"	http://vorillaz.github.io/devicons		02747349	r4vik	r4vik	78	1310287156	2011-07-10 08:39:16 UTC	141	Console.fm - New social music site	http://console.fm	based on charts of genres... but not telling where the charts come from. linked to @500startups	07671549	gkya	gkya	82	1398830682	2014-04-30 04:04:42 UTC	141	Uncleftish Beholding: English minus the non-Germanic words (1998)	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/alt.language.artificial/ZL4e3fD7eW0/_7p8bKwLJWkJ		02010208	paganel	paganel	83	1292454107	2010-12-15 23:01:47 UTC	141	"\Americans sense that something is wrong with the places where we live and work\"""""	http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/96sep/kunstler/kunstler.htm		-16585535	zrail	zrail	84	1382363902	2013-10-21 13:58:22 UTC	141	Post-mortem of a Dead-on-Arrival SaaS Product	https://www.petekeen.net/marginalia-postmortem		04473833	FredericJ	FredericJ	84	1346752246	2012-09-04 09:50:46 UTC	141	UDID Leak : Identifying the Traitor	http://fredericjacobs.com/identifying-the-traitor		07123364	timr	timr	86	1390699124	2014-01-26 01:18:44 UTC	141	Mac Pro (late 2013) replica inside a real trashcan	http://www.tonymacx86.com/mac-pro-mods/120757-mac-pro-late-2013-replica.html		-15068445	fam	fam	87	1358363658	2013-01-16 19:14:18 UTC	141	Kid Sends Blunt Cover Letter and Now People are Trying to Hire Him	http://finance.yahoo.com/news/kid-sends-perfectly-blunt-cover-letter-for-wall-street-internship--and-now-tons-of-people-are-trying-to-hire-him-151518002.html		01972634	michaelnovati	michaelnovati	106	1291582256	2010-12-05 20:50:56 UTC	141	Introducing the New Profile	http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=462201327130		03264849	thebootstrapper	thebootstrapper	117	1321955502	2011-11-22 09:51:42 UTC	141	Scala Feels like EJB 2 	http://blog.joda.org/2011/11/scala-feels-like-ejb-2-and-other.html		18066196	ethana	ethana	119	1405979163	2014-07-21 21:46:03 UTC	141	2013 Tesla Model S Long-Term Road Test	http://www.edmunds.com/tesla/model-s/2013/long-term-road-test/2013-tesla-model-s-drive-unit-iv-the-milling.html		08337460	digisth	digisth	145	1411072195	2014-09-18 20:29:55 UTC	141	Why Is Peter Thiel Pessimistic About Technological Innovation?	http://danwang.co/why-is-peter-thiel-pessimistic-about-technological-innovation/		07418504	jseliger	jseliger	157	1395094653	2014-03-17 22:17:33 UTC	141	"America Has a Black-Market Problem, Not a Drug Problem"	http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/03/america-has-a-black-market-problem-not-a-drug-problem/284447/		08120079	whoishiring	whoishiring	162	1406904352	2014-08-01 14:45:52 UTC	141	Ask HN: Freelancer?

I apologize for the somewhat sensationalist title, but it really is rather true.<p>Out of Milk started off as a dedicated Android project as our attempt to create an application for Android phones that absolutely screamed quality. We looked at the apps currently available on Google's Market and realized that there is a lack of quality applications with dedicated developers. We have spent a lot of money and a lot of time trying to prove that Android is a robust and high-quality platform. Unfortunately, Google is making this extremely difficult.<p>I am a developer / co-founder of one the most popular Shopping List and Productivity applications on the Android Market. Our application is called Out of Milk (https://Market.android.com/details?id=com.capigami.outofmilk).  As of right now, we are currently nearing 1 million downloads, a gigantic install base of users, and over 6000 ratings, nearly all 4-5 stars.  Over the past several weeks, it is almost as if Google is working against the people contributing applications to their Market.  Google is consistently releasing updates to the Market that is consistently and thoroughly making it impossible to be profitable in one of the most aggressive and fast-moving markets on the internet.  I'd like to outline the bevy of issues we have been facing.<p>1) Statistics - Developers get to see statistics for their applications in the Developer Console which are updated regularly (usually on a daily basis).  These statistics include how many downloads you have had, how many users have your application installed, how many ratings you have, and other important metrics for your application.  The stats showing the total number of users who have your app installed will randomly freeze.  For the past month, it's only been updated a few times due to issues with the Developer Console.  At the same time this is happening, your competitors may or may not be experiencing the same issue.  The stats are a factor in your apps ranking on the Market so if your stats stagnate it may give your competitor an unfair edge in the Market.  Once the statistics start working again, they do not work retroactively, it just starts where it originally froze.  The last time it froze for us, 3% of our install base magically disappeared because we got a ton of downloads but no installations over a 2 week period.<p>2) Market Search - This is the big killer.  Before the updates to the Market over the past few weeks, searching for our application by its content type would consistently put us near the top of the results.  I believe that this is correct due to the fact that we are extremely popular and well-reviewed.  However, now when searching in our application category, we are result #227.  We are consistently being beaten by hundreds of application that have 10-50 downloads, zero ratings, and absolutely no Market history.  This has caused our purchases to fall from doing very well to almost getting no purchases at all.  Google's Market updates are effectively making sure that Out of Milk cannot continue development due to not making enough to cover operating costs.<p>3) Comment Sorting - When visiting applications on the Market, the comment ratings consistently display in a very strange manner, almost as if there is no sorting at all. Instead of showing the most recent reviews that may praise us for adding a new feature or condemn us for a bug, it is displaying reviews from the beginning of the year that may or may not be relevant to the application by this point in its lifecycle.  Users who visit the application and read reviews that are extremely out of date do not get a good overview of what this application is about.<p>4) Google Support -  This is a complete joke. I am not even sure why Google is providing support at all.  We contact Google on a regular basis trying to find out about our issues and how we can recover from them.  If Google replies, it usually takes well over 3 days for them to reply with a canned response. After asking as to how we can fix our Market ranking results in the search and for a status update if they are working on it, the reply was, and this is almost an exact quote, \Google is always working to make the Market even better.\"".<p>The four issues I have detailed above are game breakers.  How can Google expect developers to get involved in the Market if the success of their application is completely based on the whim of broken updates to their software?  Out of Milk went from doing extremely well to dead in the water almost overnight.  We are working as hard we can to try and figure out solutions from our own end, but Google is the guy driving this bus and we can only do so much on our own.<p>My advice to people who are currently looking to get into developing for Android: wait.  There is absolutely no benefit to spending your time, money and effort on getting involved in the Android Market place at this time. Google is actively working to make sure that you, the developer, cannot and will not succeed in their Market.  That sounds like a bald-faced lie, I know, but it is the only conclusion I can come to in this matter. Visit the support forums for Android Developers and look at the hundreds of threads about these same issues with absolutely zero replies and it all becomes a little clearer."""	05073487	joubert	joubert	81	1358440467	2013-01-17 16:34:27 UTC	142	Go concurrency patterns	http://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide#1		09425316	luckysahaf	luckysahaf	81	1429772435	2015-04-23 07:00:35 UTC	142	Relationships Are More Important Than Ambition (2013)	http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/relationships-are-more-important-than-ambition/275025/?utm_source=pocket8&amp;single_page=true		01957514	loewenskind	loewenskind	93	1291201942	2010-12-01 11:12:22 UTC	142	How to destroy your business with one email	http://www.yelp.com/biz/epic-data-recovery-labs-new-york		-18344345	philh	philh	98	1411215871	2014-09-20 12:24:31 UTC	142	"Ads work by cultural imprinting, not emotional inception"	http://www.meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/		04666043	hornokplease	hornokplease	99	1350502409	2012-10-17 19:33:29 UTC	142	"Jack Dorsey: Let's Reconsider Our \Users\"""""	http://jacks.tumblr.com/post/33785796042/lets-reconsider-our-users		01494808	MikeCapone	MikeCapone	101	1278524133	2010-07-07 17:35:33 UTC	142	300 actions a minute?

"I just stumbled upon this piece on Business Insider \JustFab Raises $76 Million To Create The H&#38;M Fashion Brand Of The Web\"".  http://www.businessinsider.com/justfab-raises-76-million-to-create-the-hm-fashion-brand-of-the-web-2012-7<p>It kept me wonder why a company with very questionable (I will try to avoid using the word \""fraudulent\"") business model was able to raise big money. Didn't the VCs have to do the due diligence?<p>I didn't have any direct experience with JustFab. The victim was my girlfriend. Back in January or so, one of her friends emailed her a link to JustFab, then she bought a pair of shoes from www.justfab.com and never visit the website again. Only 8 months later, in early September she was appalled to find out that her credit card has been charged a $39.95 fee for the last eight months. Yes, $39.95 for 8 months, without geting anything from JustFab.<p>I then did a bit research on the internet. It turned out my girlfriend wasn't the only victim. Apparently JustFab works like this: once you buy something from their website, you become their \""VIP member\"". Then you will have to log into their website between the 1st-5th of each month and click ��_��_��_Skip This Month��_�. If no action is taken (either skip this month, or cancel your account), they just charge you a $39.95 fee every month.<p>According to the Business insider article, JustFab \""will generate about $100 million this year\"" in sales, I wonder how much of this $100 million are from people like my girlfriend who simply didn't read their entire 2,500 words Terms of Service and were unaware that they were charged $39.95 a month for nothing.<p>p.s. After JustFab CSR refused to refund, I decide to post this story again, hoping it will get upvoted to the frontpage of HN so that more people get to know what is really going on behind JustFab<p>pps. Anyone could just simply google \""justfab scam\"" to see how many others have been victimized. It's outrageous such large scale scam got unnoticed."""	01300882	mcantelon	mcantelon	70	1272434834	2010-04-28 06:07:14 UTC	149	93% of 2006 AAA-rated subprime mortgage-backed securities now rated junk	http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/opinion/26krugman.html		-18224059	luu	luu	73	1408998620	2014-08-25 20:30:20 UTC	149	Why Do Nigerian Scammers Say They Are from Nigeria?

I didn&#x27;t want the people who are going to inherit HN from me to have to build it as their first project, because it interacts with so many different bits of the code in such subtle ways.<p>So I found time to implement pending comments this past week, and with any luck it will launch tonight. Since it&#x27;s a big change, I wanted to warn HN users in advance.<p>Here&#x27;s how it currently works.  From now on, when you post a comment, it won&#x27;t initially be live. It will be in a new state called pending.  Comments get from pending to live by being endorsed by multiple HN users with over 1000 karma.  Those users will see pending comments, and will be able to endorse them by clicking on an &quot;endorse&quot; link next to the &quot;flag&quot; link.<p>Someone who has a pending comment will have to wait till it goes live to post another.  We&#x27;re hoping that good comments will get endorsed so quickly that there won&#x27;t be a noticeable delay.<p>You can currently beat the system by posting an innocuous comment, waiting for it to be endorsed, and then after it&#x27;s live, changing it to say something worse. We explicitly ask people not to do this.  While we have no software for catching it, humans will notice, and we&#x27;ll ban you.<p>Along with the change in software will come a change in policy.  We&#x27;re going to ask users with the ability to endorse comments only to endorse those that:<p>1. Say something substantial.  E.g. not just a throwaway remark, or the kind of &quot;Yes you did, No I didn&#x27;t&quot; bickering that races toward the right side of the page and no one cares about except the participants.<p>2. Say it without gratuitous nastiness.  In particular, a comment in reply to another comment should be written in the spirit of colleagues cooperating in good faith to figure out the truth about something, not politicians trying to ridicule and misrepresent the other side.<p>People who regularly endorse comments that fail one or both of these tests will lose the ability to endorse comments.  So if you&#x27;re not sure whether you should endorse a comment, don&#x27;t.  There are a lot of people on HN.  If a point is important, someone else will probably come along and make it without gratuitous nastiness.<p>I hope this will improve the quality of HN comments significantly, but we&#x27;ll need your help to make it work, and your forbearance if, as usually happens, some things go wrong initially."	03201033	joeyespo	joeyespo	72	1320529976	2011-11-05 21:52:56 UTC	150	Python: copying a list the right way	http://henry.precheur.org/python/copy_list		02940133	abraham	abraham	78	1314679018	2011-08-30 04:36:58 UTC	150	An update on attempted man-in-the-middle attacks	http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/08/update-on-attempted-man-in-middle.html		-13036618	rizumu	rizumu	85	1316981320	2011-09-25 20:08:40 UTC	150	"Manufacturing \A Minimal Pen\"" in China, failures and successes"""	http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cwandt/pen-type-a-a-minimal-pen/posts/122492?ref=email&show_token=211fce8da0f216dd		-17060951	lifthrasiir	lifthrasiir	85	1389747357	2014-01-15 00:55:57 UTC	150	The Periodic Table of Rust Types	http://cosmic.mearie.org/2014/01/periodic-table-of-rust-types/		04506385	mtgx	mtgx	95	1347381510	2012-09-11 16:38:30 UTC	150	"\Six strikes\"" Internet warning system will come to US this year"""	http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/six-strikes-internet-warning-system-really-truly-coming-to-us-this-year/		03026230	jaf12duke	jaf12duke	103	1316702721	2011-09-22 14:45:21 UTC	150	Don't try this at home.

"When my startup last year did terribly, I felt like crap. While it wasn't really a surprise (I kinda knew it was going to happen), it was a pretty painful experience.<p>Having said that, it's nothing compared to what I feel now. I sincerely, truly believed that my current startup had potential to grow but I lost the one chance I had. After failing our startup last year, we picked up on advice from HN- we started over. We finally found something we truly believed in and created our first iPhone App after 6 months. Given that we didn't have any programming or design experience, we worked like hell to really make up for all the areas we were lacking in. Were barely surviving by (we had left our jobs since the last failed startup) and working nonstop because this was THE idea we believed in.<p>One of the startup advice that I hear most often is to create a product that solves a problem of your own (37signals) because there's bound to be people like you who have the same problem. During our last startup, we sacrificed all the time we had with friends, family, and ignored our relationships for the most part. It was miserable and lonely but we were naive and still dreaming of get rich quick schemes. We decided to finally create Grooovy after months of brainstorming ideas and really felt a connection with it. Grooovy (http://www.grooovy.me) was designed to be a social meetup app for iphone that allowed users to meet over drinks, food or a snack within 75 miles of their current location. That was the key- it would really tackle the problem of not being able to meet people and just socialize especially when you're working odd hours and unable to meet anyone new outside of school or work. We wouldn't have to feel lonely!<p>We asked everyone we knew, even tried to find complete strangers to get an honest opinion. People were excited, we criticized ourselves harshly and improved on all the feedback/suggestions we got. When we were finally close to launching, we ran a series of beta tests which passed with flying colors. Everyone who had a chance to use it (Thank you again) thought it was a very valid and new way of socializing. It would be something new, a networking tool used for platonic relationships and not just dating. We spent extra time revising, bug testing, fixing whatever we could to the best of our abilities.<p>But then geotargeting happened. When we launched, we had about 3,xxx downloads starting the first few days- everything looked good. What we didn't expect was how far each user be from one another. A limit of 75miles is nothing when you're selling an app to the entire United States. We immediately got 2 reviews and a ton of feedback telling us that our idea was worth 5 stars but the app didn't work! The reason why it didn't work was because nobody was close to one another to see each other's events! This was a terrible mistake that we should've caught on. By the time that we launched a new revised update and let users know how many people were in their current area and fix what we needed, our app rank had plummeted to the 799th place under social networking. I'm still getting emails occasionally asking me when the app would be fixed, and it's ridiculous that I have to tell them that the App is working but there's not not enough people in their area!<p>At this point, I don't see much hope for recovery- We're at the end of our string and don't know what else we can do. I really needed to rant because this was something I had truly believed it, I truly worked hard for and believed that it wasn't just something stupid I created again on a whim. We tried to follow every piece of advice we were given, learned to be humble, continued to believe in ourselves but feel like all is useless now because we can't geotarget specific cities with the iphone like SF Bay Area or San Diego!<p>Edit: Sorry for the long rant, just had to let out some anger. Thank you."	-17750935	lvevjo	lvevjo	134	1400175435	2014-05-15 17:37:15 UTC	152	How extreme isolation warps the mind	http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140514-how-extreme-isolation-warps-minds		-18713571	plg	plg	144	1417986496	2014-12-07 21:08:16 UTC	152	You can't dig upwards	http://www.evanmiller.org/you-cant-dig-upwards.html		04401606	louhong	louhong	156	1345309423	2012-08-18 17:03:43 UTC	152	Ben Horowitz: A Good Place to Work	http://bhorowitz.com/2012/08/18/a-good-place-to-work/		06931217	steveklabnik	steveklabnik	181	1387404642	2013-12-18 22:10:42 UTC	152	"Bitcoin, Magical Thinking, and Political Ideology"	https://al3x.net/2013/12/18/bitcoin.html		06133349	sinak	sinak	612	1375275943	2013-07-31 13:05:43 UTC	1688	XKeyscore: NSA program collects 'nearly everything a user does on the internet'	http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data		05278015	j_col	j_col	70	1361783724	2013-02-25 09:15:24 UTC	153	"LG acquires webOS from HP, plans to use it in smart TV platform"	http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/25/lg-acquires-webos-from-hp-smart-tv-future/		11766603	amadiver	amadiver	70	1286417572	2010-10-07 02:12:52 UTC	153	The Gentle Art of Poverty	http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/1969/12/the-gentle-art-of-poverty/8241/		02236662	kn0thing	kn0thing	76	1298054823	2011-02-18 18:47:03 UTC	153	How reddit became reddit - the biggest smallest community online	http://alexisohanian.com/how-reddit-became-reddit-the-smallest-biggest		05943750	alexholehouse	alexholehouse	76	1372213231	2013-06-26 02:20:31 UTC	153	"Understanding the linux filesystem (/etc, /var, /bin, /opt etc.)"	http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/		03928006	tokenadult	tokenadult	82	1336133079	2012-05-04 12:04:39 UTC	153	Dangerous Things You Were Taught In School	http://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicahagy/2012/05/02/nine-dangerous-things-you-were-taught-in-school/		04335893	dshipper	dshipper	83	1344024249	2012-08-03 20:04:09 UTC	153	"B2B Is Unsexy, and I Know It"	http://danshipper.com/b2b-is-unsexy-and-i-know-it		09735358	agumonkey	agumonkey	83	1434575563	2015-06-17 21:12:43 UTC	153	A reimplementation of NetBSD using a Microkernel [video]	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pebP891V0c		08805260	olalonde	olalonde	84	1419741768	2014-12-28 04:42:48 UTC	153	Microservices ��_��_��_ Not a free��_��_lunch	http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a-free-lunch.html		08303785	hencq	hencq	86	1410455849	2014-09-11 17:17:29 UTC	153	First set of Android apps for ChromeOS	http://chrome.blogspot.com/2014/09/first-set-of-android-apps-coming-to.html		04488910	nonrecursive	nonrecursive	86	1347024767	2012-09-07 13:32:47 UTC	153	"Show HN: My first Mac app, Foreman, free and on Github.

Fukuyama has published several papers in computer science. it would be great if the online community could give this some attention as with the Deolalikar proof from 2.5yrs ago.	03064952	kfalter	kfalter	89	1317613454	2011-10-03 03:44:14 UTC	156	Node.js cures cancer	http://blog.brianbeck.com/post/node-js-cures-cancer		-110269418	tweakz	tweakz	106	1443059781	2015-09-24 01:56:21 UTC	156	Django 1.9 alpha 1 released	https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/sep/23/django-19-alpha-1-released/		09726341	QUFB	QUFB	114	1434467424	2015-06-16 15:10:24 UTC	156	Cardinals Face F.B.I.

Am I a fool for thinking I can avoid this at a startup?		"(been on HN for half a decade, but posting anonymously because I could be perceived as damaged goods and hence unemployable)<p>The story is a familiar one to readers here, so I'll spare the details.  Abusive management, perpetual \crisis mode,\"" promises repeatedly broken, entrenched technical incompetence, smothering bureaucracy, vomit-inducing organizational politics -- the whole nine yards.<p>I started as a wide-eyed youngster desiring to prove myself, went through the denial phase, and ultimately suffered a total loss of motivation.  Since then I've left the job to spend some time recovering, soul-searching, and gathering what I can as lessons learned.<p>Right now I'd say that I have the (financial) risk tolerance to work at a startup, as well as the desire to work on challenging and meaningful tasks, especially with growth and learning opportunities and a level of ownership such that I can take pride in my work.  But I doubt I have the dedication or interest in the business aspects necessary to start a company of my own, hence my willingness to give the startup employee route a shot.<p>However, given my experience with burnout, I feel that I may be excessively skeptical of what any employer would have to offer.  Of the problems I mentioned before, everything other than the red tape could just as well happen in a startup.  The obsession with \""rockstars\"" and \""ninjas\"" who have unwavering \""passion\"" just smells like a search for na��_��_ve, exploitable labor willing to give up evenings and weekends for foosball games and beer.  The prevalence of social bubble-worthy companies whose value propositions are little more than \""cat pictures\"" suggests an inflated sense of self-importance among the founders, and I can't expect to keep my level of enthusiasm in line with their irrational exuberance.  And while I don't need much job security, having the specter of financial instability looming over the office tends to be at minimum somewhat distracting and most likely quite demotivating.<p>Perhaps a startup that has gone through the vetting process with YC would have less of these issues, but even then I have some doubts.  I'm not in any position to question PG's judgment, but after seeing some of the announcements of companies funded and the infamous \""YC company seeks brogrammer\"" job post, I have a feeling that his evaluation metrics for founders may significantly diverge from mine.<p>I recently passed up an opportunity at a very high-profile technology company mainly because everyone on the team was required to carry pagers.  It just didn't feel right, especially for an established business that claimed it was being run like a lean startup.  But it did get me thinking -- why would an actual startup not require the same?<p>tl,dr: Can I expect to find a position with the potential professional rewards of working at a startup, while still setting strict boundaries on work to preserve my sanity?

I can count on one elbow the number of times I have seen the word \fanboy\"" or its faux-hipster alternate \""fanboi\"" used in a comment that led to a productive discussion.<p>Everyone has opinions about consumer electronics. Everyone's entitled to them, even when they're wrong. I owned and liked a Windows Tablet PC at one time! But truly and honestly, are we discussing things that gratify our intellectual curiosity when we attack each other or the authors of the fine articles for their bias? Are we really bringing fresh insights to the table when we complain that the marketplace is capricious and sometimes values things we think are superficial?<p>As hackers--and I include in this definition those who hack software, hardware, social behaviour, and marketplaces--our mission is first to UNDERSTAND and then second to INFLUENCE. When we read a review, no matter what we personally think of its flagrant bias or the comments of others on the thread, we should aggressively throttle our temptation to wield the flame-hammer. We need to ask ourselves, \""What understanding would my comment add?\""<p>The same is true when we see someone else violating these precepts. The downvote (and flag, where available and appropriate) are the right tools for the job. Most of the time, calling someone out for diluting the discourse simply adds to the noise while simultaneously feeding the troll.<p>(This is one of the reasons I have a personal policy of either responding or downvoting but never both. If it deserves a constructive reply, why is it worth a downvote? If the reply would not be constructive, I downvote and move on.)<p>If we as a community are unable to throttle the bile effectively, then perhaps we should ask the moderators to do it for us. There's no shame in deciding that non-technical articles about iPads or surfaces or what-have-you are better off in /r/technology.<p>I know that in a few days or a week these articles will go away as the novelty of newly released products fade. But the reason I am speaking out regardless is that the echoes of this type of discourse last much longer and I fear they will spill over into other threads. I believe that forums like this need a zero-tolerance policy towards the kind of divisive incivility I've read lately.<p>I'll close by misappropriating an old joke: \""Do you know why the flames about consumer electronics are so vicious? Because the stakes are so low.\"""""	07422881	nicholascloud	nicholascloud	76	1395160131	2014-03-18 16:28:51 UTC	160	How to be a sane programmer	http://www.nicholascloud.com/2014/03/how-to-be-a-sane-programmer/		09231386	gvido	gvido	83	1426768111	2015-03-19 12:28:31 UTC	160	Ask HN: How would you implement a verifiable open-source web application?		"Wasn&#x27;t really sure how to make the title descriptive enough without putting the full question there.<p>Anyway, I have been toying with the idea of creating an open-source web application. Open-source in the way that I would host the product on my own servers but the full source code, except, of course, authentication info, tokens and things which shouldn&#x27;t be under source control anyway, would be available on Github. Anyone would also be able to set up a self-hosted version of the product, and if anyone wanted to contribute, I would accept pull requests, etc.<p>The idea behind that was that, since it would be targeted mostly at a tech-savy crowd and deals with personal information, I would like to introduce some level of trust that I&#x27;m not doing anything sneaky or unexpected behind the scenes (like storing information I shouldn&#x27;t be).<p>So basically I started wondering if it is possible to implement a way people could verify that the same code they see on the Github repo is the code that&#x27;s also running on the live hosted site? I will be working with node.js, but I don&#x27;t think the tech stack is too relevant here.<p>The client-side part, as I imagined it, would be relatively trivial to verify - run the build part locally, compare fingerprint of the live code and the local version.<p>But my idea got stuck on the server side. Since there, even if I would make a server side endpoint that returns the fingerprint of the live code, there is no way for someone to check what is actually going on, I could just as well return a static file with a hardcoded fingerprint.<p>I&#x27;m sure someone has dealt with or thought about similar problems before, and I would be happy to hear some insights. Feels like this might be a pipe dream, but at least some level of verification would be nice to achieve."	09495883	wglb	wglb	85	1430871634	2015-05-06 00:20:34 UTC	160	Lawyers threaten researcher over key-cloning bug in high-security lock	http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/05/lawyers-threaten-researcher-over-key-cloning-bug-in-high-security-lock/		-18761902	sjcsjc	sjcsjc	96	1418815140	2014-12-17 11:19:00 UTC	160	The largest vessel the world has ever seen	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-30394137		03293499	e03179	e03179	103	1322622612	2011-11-30 03:10:12 UTC	160	"Music artist: \Why I prefer piracy to Spotify\"""""	http://derekwebb.tumblr.com/post/13503899950/giving-it-away-how-free-music-makes-more-than-sense		04723591	julien_c	julien_c	104	1351700478	2012-10-31 16:21:18 UTC	160	"Show HN: Circular, an open source clone of Buffer"	http://circular.io/		0758458	henning	henning	113	1250094243	2009-08-12 16:24:03 UTC	160	"Forget Starbucks, work at the library instead"	http://davecaolo.com/productivity/forget-starbucks-work-at-the-library/		02242721	wiks	wiks	124	1298229687	2011-02-20 19:21:27 UTC	160	Google May Kill Chrome URL Bar	http://www.conceivablytech.com/5746/products/google-may-kill-chrome-url-bar/		07954778	dboyd	dboyd	160	1403886366	2014-06-27 16:26:06 UTC	160	Dart 1.5	http://news.dartlang.org/2014/06/dart-15-makes-it-easier-to-develop-for.html		06884552	tagabek	tagabek	163	1386716861	2013-12-10 23:07:41 UTC	160	"Ask HN: Those making $1,000+/month on side projects - what did you make?"

"	Before becoming a team lead, I was the type of developer who, when given a task, would dig into the application api&#x27;s, the database schema, the configuration, whatever it took to fill in the gaps to accomplish the task. Sure I&#x27;d get stumped sometimes, but I&#x27;d always try to ask for help sooner rather than later.<p>Now, I&#x27;m a lead of 4 developers. Two are like I was, I can give them a task, they&#x27;ll go do it with minimal guidance. The other two will spend hugely more time on tasks. I&#x27;ve notice they tend to go off on tangents, spending time things that aren&#x27;t relevant, like setting up vm envirnoments they don&#x27;t need when they can develop and test locally. There have been occassions when they have asked me for help, and then a week later come back with the same question as though we had never talked about it.<p>It&#x27;s baffling to me, it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re &quot;scatterbrained&quot;, ie not focused or concentrated. How does one manage people like this?"	-12143977	oojacoboo	oojacoboo	247	1296062537	2011-01-26 17:22:17 UTC	179	Ask HN: Review RentPost.com	http://rentpost.com	"After our team has spent the last 2 years in development, working countless hours, we have been able to FINALLY push out our service to the public!

"HN,<p>A startup that I am part of failed. Prereq: USA, C-Corp in Delaware. We have $6k in server fees to Rackspace and $3k in debt with our lawyer. We also have a huge amount of credit card fraud that went through our credit card processing account/merchant account (like $8k), which is going to be an ongoing issue for the next year+ and may end up in me and my SSN being blacklisted from Visa and Mastercard.<p>I used to be able to cover this kind of failure, but over the past few months, I've sunk tons of my money into this company and completely depleted my checking and savings accounts.<p>The account goes into collections in the first week of October (which means my credit will be destroyed). I will be leaving the startup after I sort everything out.<p>I need a way to make this $6k in about 12 days. My savings is shot. I have some consulting (WordPress, PHP, Rails) money coming in, but it's only $1k and might not even be on time. My co-founder owns a majority of the company but he's traveling so he's a bit unavailable.<p>This seems to be the \low\"" of that rollercoaster we call serial entrepreneurship. Thank you for your help, Hacker News.<p>EDIT: I'd just like to say that I'm using a throwaway because I'm pretty well known on HN, which makes this pretty interesting. I usually read these kinds of Ask HN posts and think \""ouch\""��_��_��_funny to be on the other side.<p>EDIT: I'll respond soon, HN is giving me the \""You're submitting too fast. Please slow down.

guidelines, we ask submitters to use original titles when possible.  When they don&#x27;t, we often change the title of a post back to the original title of the article.<p>There is an ongoing trickle of complaints about this, as if we were engaged in some sort of sinister conspiracy.<p>Titles on HN are not self-expression the way comments are.  Titles are common property.  The person who happens to submit something first shouldn&#x27;t thereby get the right to choose the title for everyone else. This would be clearer if we didn&#x27;t let submitters enter a title-- if our software simply let people submit urls, and retrieved the title from the page.  We don&#x27;t do this because it&#x27;s too inflexible.  Some articles have titles that are too long.  In others the subtitle makes a better title.  But the fact that a title field is editable doesn&#x27;t make it comment.<p>It&#x27;s true that when submitters change titles, their new titles often contain more information than the article&#x27;s original title.  But a significant percentage of the extra information added in this way is false.  The only way we can tell if a newly created title is accurate is to read the article, and we&#x27;re not about to read every article submitted to HN.    The only option is to revert to the original title, which is at least what the author intended.<p>(We do sometimes change titles from the original when the original title is egregious linkbait, or false.  We have also, since the beginning when our users were largely YC alumni, put e.g. (YC S13) after the names of YC companies in titles.  But these are not the types of changes users mean when they complain about moderators changing titles.)<p>If we had infinite attention to spend on moderation, we could read every article and decide whether each user-created title was better than the original title.  But we don&#x27;t.  Moderating HN is no one&#x27;s full time job.  And frankly it&#x27;s not that big a deal anyway.  If we&#x27;re going to expend cycles trying to fix something about HN, the increasing prevalence of mean and stupid comments has a much higher priority than the fact that authors&#x27; original titles are not maximally informative."	-15175870	emdagon	emdagon	73	1360150257	2013-02-06 11:30:57 UTC	183	Play framework 2.10 released	http://www.playframework.com/		01749363	eugenejen	eugenejen	82	1285981431	2010-10-02 01:03:51 UTC	183	'The Social Network': reviewed by Lawrence Lessig	http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/78081/sorkin-zuckerberg-the-social-network		07535128	tty	tty	108	1396654166	2014-04-04 23:29:26 UTC	183	Tesla Model S Ethernet Network Explored	http://www.dragtimes.com/blog/tesla-model-s-ethernet-network-explored-possible-jailbreak-in-the-future		06002596	steveklabnik	steveklabnik	109	1373217301	2013-07-07 17:15:01 UTC	183	A thorough PGP tutorial	http://futureboy.us/pgp.html		09635174	cft	cft	123	1433099671	2015-05-31 19:14:31 UTC	183	Why It Pays to Be a Jerk	http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/06/why-it-pays-to-be-a-jerk/392066/?single_page=true		08807309	benbreen	benbreen	132	1419798016	2014-12-28 20:20:16 UTC	183	That Debt from 1720?

"There are many models of routers that support open source router software&#x2F;firmware like OpenWRT, DD-WRT and Tomato. However, when you look around, it&#x27;s very difficult to determine the recency of router models out there and post date isn&#x27;t always useful since many use which ever router just happens to be available to them for free. If one were to decide to buy a brand new model router to install open source router software on, where would you go to find out the best current models and be able to compare their features?<p>While it would be nice to know the best models as of today (December 1st 2013), I think it&#x27;s more interesting to be taught how to fish instead of being given a fish. This also makes it easier for me (and anyone else) to pass this advice onto the next person."	08615962	deng	deng	162	1416180197	2014-11-16 23:23:17 UTC	195	Resignation from the pkg-systemd maintainer team	http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-systemd-maintainers/2014-November/004563.html		09142871	luu	luu	169	1425447510	2015-03-04 05:38:30 UTC	195	Stuff I've Messed Up While Interviewing	http://blog.ellenchisa.com/2014/04/13/stuff-ive-screwed-up-while-interviewing/		09566441	Aloha	Aloha	182	1431978132	2015-05-18 19:42:12 UTC	451	Fish shell	http://fishshell.com/		04632341	lforrest	lforrest	74	1349799178	2012-10-09 16:12:58 UTC	196	Firefox debuts new developer toolbar	https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2012/10/09/firefox-debuts-new-developer-toolbar/		010351140	apsec112	apsec112	86	1444283695	2015-10-08 05:54:55 UTC	196	Fifth Amendment Flowchart	http://lawcomic.net/guide/?p=2897		06580592	lcedp	lcedp	94	1382289928	2013-10-20 17:25:28 UTC	196	This is a valid ipv4 address	http://3098282570		03909628	nwjsmith	nwjsmith	95	1335799604	2012-04-30 15:26:44 UTC	196	Ctrl-P for Vim: Pure Vimscript Command-T	https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim	I didn't write it but I thought HNers would be interested.<p>Send praise to https://github.com/kien!	04241638	jordanlee	jordanlee	96	1342210471	2012-07-13 20:14:31 UTC	196	"Show HN: Collections, a fast multiple-account Google Docs client for Mac"	http://beta.collections.me		06676801	willaaye	willaaye	129	1383675134	2013-11-05 18:12:14 UTC	196	"Dear Google, Thanks For Copying My Startup But You��_�re Doing It All Wrong"	http://willweinraub.com/post/66100105668/dear-google-thanks-for-copying-my-startup-but-youre		06999556	cju	cju	141	1388670823	2014-01-02 13:53:43 UTC	196	Hyperloop: Not so fast	http://blogs.mathworks.com/seth/2013/11/22/hyperloop-not-so-fast/		05799167	declan	declan	151	1370014043	2013-05-31 15:27:23 UTC	196	Judge orders Google to comply with FBI's secret NSL demands	http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57587003-38/		04416864	geelen	geelen	162	1345636207	2012-08-22 11:50:07 UTC	196	Why Ratings Systems Don't Work	http://goodfil.ms/blog/posts/2012/08/22/why-ratings-systems-dont-work/		09269221	byrain	byrain	183	1427375151	2015-03-26 13:05:51 UTC	196	Ask HN: I am the dumbest person in the room. What should I do?		"I see a lot of articles and posts about hiring the right person, dealing with underachievers, etc, but still did not see one with underachiever&#x27;s perspective.<p>I was hired 4 months ago to work for a quite desirable software company. On my interview and first days I was quite confident and a bit cocky I must admit. I thought I knew more that I actually did, but at the same time was aware that I was lacking specific experience needed for that particular job, but was very willing to work hard to develop myself, and actually saw that as a desirable challenge! I thought that mentoring and time was given to ramp up and learn the missing pieces. Non of that happened.<p>My teammates have tons of experience, and there is a clear ��_��_��_every man for himself��_� mentality. Most of them have big egos and really rotten and bitter attitudes. They are stars, they know it, and treat people who are not at the same level like idiots (like idiot me).<p>As a result, I stress through the work days trying to decode what my co-workers are thinking, and trying not to say the wrong words (which keeps me silent for most of the meetings, work days and then bleeds out into my personal life). By night I have a quick dinner and bury myself in intense study. Honestly, its horrible. My self esteem plunged, I am ashamed to communicate with talk with other people. It is wearing me out. I question myself several times per day if this is really worth it.<p>Questions:<p>1. I feel I handled this wrongly, and started with too much confidence. If I am the least knowledgeable person, and a co-worker ignores, despises and almost makes fun of me for your lack of experience, how should I act in order to maintain my dignity but also be humble enough to acknowledge the co-worker&#x27;s knowledge?<p>2. Is it normal to be hired as a junior and just being thrown to the lions, with no help or time to ramp up?<p>3. Do all star&#x2F;ninja&#x2F;rock-star software developers have rotten attitudes?"	-15056304	colin_jack	colin_jack	85	1358193947	2013-01-14 20:05:47 UTC	452	"In the Wake of Aaron Swartz's Death, Let's Fix Draconian Computer Crime Law"	https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/aaron-swartz-fix-draconian-computer-crime-law		06005162	ajdecon	ajdecon	95	1373256951	2013-07-08 04:15:51 UTC	452	"\Nothing like this will be built again\"""""	http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/rants/nothing-like-this-will-be-buil.html?		17259845	clarkm	clarkm	426	1392747348	2014-02-18 18:15:48 UTC	452	The Engineer Crunch	http://blog.samaltman.com/the-engineer-crunch		06507614	spindritf	spindritf	269	1381147276	2013-10-07 12:01:16 UTC	197	"FBI struggles to seize 600,000 Bitcoins from alleged Silk Road founder"	http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/fbi-bitcoin-silk-road-ross-ulbricht		-12151485	rkwz	rkwz	71	1296213975	2011-01-28 11:26:15 UTC	197	Views from an Egyptian	http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1968394&cid=35025842		07706915	mailpin	mailpin	74	1399408449	2014-05-06 20:34:09 UTC	197	Show HN: Turn an email to a web page	http://mailp.in/c8cN1BEb		01675807	inmygarage	inmygarage	74	1284048258	2010-09-09 16:04:18 UTC	197	I��_�m a Female Y Combinator Founder and You Can Be Too	http://amandapeyton.com/blog/2010/09/im-a-female-y-combinator-founder-and-you-can-be-too/		02778422	ssclafani	ssclafani	76	1311025647	2011-07-18 21:47:27 UTC	197	LulzSec Redirects ��_��_��_The Sun��_� Homepage To Fake Murdoch Death Story	http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/18/lulzsec-hacks-the-sun-redirects-homepage-to-fake-murdoch-death-story/		08471049	dsr12	dsr12	78	1413555206	2014-10-17 14:13:26 UTC	197	"What Is Google Chrome Helper, and Why Is It Hogging My CPU Cycles?"	http://www.wired.com/2014/10/google-chrome-helper/		03013654	Zephyr314	Zephyr314	87	1316442390	2011-09-19 14:26:30 UTC	197	A resume template in TeX	http://github.com/sc932/resume	This is my resume in LaTeX.
