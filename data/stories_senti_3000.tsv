As far as I can tell, two of our experiments are working.<p>The first is posting feedback in the threads about what&#x27;s good and bad for HN comments. Right now, dang is the only one doing this, but other moderators may in the future. We&#x27;ve learned some things about how to do it: 1) the feedback should be as neutral as possible; 2) it should be about the comment, not the commenter; and 3) where possible, it should say what would make the comment better.<p>Other HN users have been pitching in with feedback too, which is great! If you&#x27;d like to help, please do. Just try to follow the three guidelines above.<p>The second experiment is a change we made to the comment scoring and ranking algorithms. These algorithms do more than just counting and sorting because pg wrote a lot of code to address systemic issues as they came up over the years. But the community doesn&#x27;t stay static, so the algorithms shouldn&#x27;t either.<p>After studying the data, dang and kogir tuned the algorithms to make some downvotes more powerful. We&#x27;ve been monitoring the effects of this change, and it appears to be reducing toxic comments.<p>The majority of HN users are thoughtful and nice. It&#x27;s clear from the data that they reliably downvote jerks and trolls (and specifically, they donâ€™t silence minority groupsâ€”weâ€™ve looked into this). What dang and kogir found was a way to turn the volume up on this kind of downvote. We believe this has made the comment scores and rankings better reflect the community.<p>We will be trying a lot more experiments.

It will be in a new state called pending.  Comments get from pending to live by being endorsed by multiple HN users with over 1000 karma.  Those users will see pending comments, and will be able to endorse them by clicking on an &quot;endorse&quot; link next to the &quot;flag&quot; link.<p>Someone who has a pending comment will have to wait till it goes live to post another.  We&#x27;re hoping that good comments will get endorsed so quickly that there won&#x27;t be a noticeable delay.<p>You can currently beat the system by posting an innocuous comment, waiting for it to be endorsed, and then after it&#x27;s live, changing it to say something worse. We explicitly ask people not to do this.  While we have no software for catching it, humans will notice, and we&#x27;ll ban you.<p>Along with the change in software will come a change in policy.  We&#x27;re going to ask users with the ability to endorse comments only to endorse those that:<p>1. Say something substantial.  E.g. not just a throwaway remark, or the kind of &quot;Yes you did, No I didn&#x27;t&quot; bickering that races toward the right side of the page and no one cares about except the participants.<p>2. Say it without gratuitous nastiness.  In particular, a comment in reply to another comment should be written in the spirit of colleagues cooperating in good faith to figure out the truth about something, not politicians trying to ridicule and misrepresent the other side.<p>People who regularly endorse comments that fail one or both of these tests will lose the ability to endorse comments.  So if you&#x27;re not sure whether you should endorse a comment, don&#x27;t.  There are a lot of people on HN.  If a point is important, someone else will probably come along and make it without gratuitous nastiness.<p>I hope this will improve the quality of HN comments significantly, but we&#x27;ll need your help to make it work, and your forbearance if, as usually happens, some things go wrong initially."	010113639	mrmirz	mrmirz	The most profitable source of income for banks?

Sure I&#x27;d get stumped sometimes, but I&#x27;d always try to ask for help sooner rather than later.<p>Now, I&#x27;m a lead of 4 developers. Two are like I was, I can give them a task, they&#x27;ll go do it with minimal guidance. The other two will spend hugely more time on tasks. I&#x27;ve notice they tend to go off on tangents, spending time things that aren&#x27;t relevant, like setting up vm envirnoments they don&#x27;t need when they can develop and test locally. There have been occassions when they have asked me for help, and then a week later come back with the same question as though we had never talked about it.<p>It&#x27;s baffling to me, it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re &quot;scatterbrained&quot;, ie not focused or concentrated.

When they don&#x27;t, we often change the title of a post back to the original title of the article.<p>There is an ongoing trickle of complaints about this, as if we were engaged in some sort of sinister conspiracy.<p>Titles on HN are not self-expression the way comments are.  Titles are common property.  The person who happens to submit something first shouldn&#x27;t thereby get the right to choose the title for everyone else. This would be clearer if we didn&#x27;t let submitters enter a title-- if our software simply let people submit urls, and retrieved the title from the page.  We don&#x27;t do this because it&#x27;s too inflexible.  Some articles have titles that are too long.  In others the subtitle makes a better title.  But the fact that a title field is editable doesn&#x27;t make it comment.<p>It&#x27;s true that when submitters change titles, their new titles often contain more information than the article&#x27;s original title.  But a significant percentage of the extra information added in this way is false.  The only way we can tell if a newly created title is accurate is to read the article, and we&#x27;re not about to read every article submitted to HN.    The only option is to revert to the original title, which is at least what the author intended.<p>(We do sometimes change titles from the original when the original title is egregious linkbait, or false.  We have also, since the beginning when our users were largely YC alumni, put e.g. (YC S13) after the names of YC companies in titles.  But these are not the types of changes users mean when they complain about moderators changing titles.)<p>If we had infinite attention to spend on moderation, we could read every article and decide whether each user-created title was better than the original title.  But we don&#x27;t.  Moderating HN is no one&#x27;s full time job.  And frankly it&#x27;s not that big a deal anyway.  If we&#x27;re going to expend cycles trying to fix something about HN, the increasing prevalence of mean and stupid comments has a much higher priority than the fact that authors&#x27; original titles are not maximally informative."	-1352800	speek	speek	Tell HN: Vote.	289	1225762143	2008-11-04 01:29:03 UTC	184	"If you can, vote.

Bulletproof protocols usually require peer review, yet there have been zero leaks from the reviewers.  Pools of crypto guys who don't leak stuff are usually employed by governments.<p>The part that puzzles me is why a government would do this.  I can imagine several possibilities:<p>1. To finance their own black operations.<p>2. Because they thought digital currencies were inevitable, and they preferred bitcoin to some potentially more malevolent form.  (Could bitcoin have been worse from a government's point of view?)<p>3. A friend suggested this: because they felt their currency would never become the standard reserve currency, and they felt it was better that no one's be if theirs couldn't be.<p>4. A variant of the above: the US did it because it seemed inevitable that the dollar would eventually lose its place as the standard reserve currency, and better to have it replaced by bitcoin that the yuan.<p>I realize some of these explanations are pretty far fetched, but so is an individual cooking up bitcoin as an intellectual exercise.  Whatever the explanation of bitcoin's origin turns out to be, it will probably be pretty weird.<p>Anyone have opinions about these possible explanations, or other ones?"	05256051	chmars	chmars	Thrown Off a United Airlines Flight for Taking Pictures	237	1361432476	2013-02-21 07:41:16 UTC	203		05830633	FlemishBeeCycle	FlemishBeeCycle	Confirmed: The NSA is Spying on Millions of Americans	444	1370496695	2013-06-06 05:31:35 UTC	1227		0981618	maudineormsby	maudineormsby	"Crunchpad renamed \JooJoo\"" will cost $499 on sale Dec. 11"""	211	1260208375	2009-12-07 17:52:55 UTC	204		08308666	comatose_kid	comatose_kid	New Requests for Startups	390	1410536814	2014-09-12 15:46:54 UTC	716		010359517	yummyfajitas	yummyfajitas	Why Do High-Frequency Traders Cancel So Many Orders?	234	1444393316	2015-10-09 12:21:56 UTC	205		05510914	praptak	praptak	Taping of Farm Cruelty Is Becoming the Crime	437	1365416844	2013-04-08 10:27:24 UTC	717		02306289	rbanffy	rbanffy	Xcode now costs US$ 4.99	385	1299703128	2011-03-09 20:38:48 UTC	207		04838215	ssclafani	ssclafani	Silicon Valley's dirty secret - age bias	244	1354042947	2012-11-27 19:02:27 UTC	207		-19914024	albedoa	albedoa	Online Cheating Site AshleyMadison Hacked	353	1437367183	2015-07-20 04:39:43 UTC	208		05287474	rdl	rdl	Appleâ€™s Deleting iCloud Emails That Contain The Phrase 'Barely Legal Teens'	385	1361904041	2013-02-26 18:40:41 UTC	464		04834372	asherlangton	asherlangton	"Leaping Brain's \Virtually Uncrackable\"" DRM is just an XOR with \""RANDOM_STRING\"""""	254	1353968757	2012-11-26 22:25:57 UTC	720		08212340	yaddayadda	yaddayadda	Hard Science About Diet	229	1408719194	2014-08-22 14:53:14 UTC	209		06343994	RockyMcNuts	RockyMcNuts	Infectious disease doesn't care why you're unvaccinated	227	1378528640	2013-09-07 04:37:20 UTC	211		-16511491	olegp	olegp	Nuclear fusion milestone passed at US lab	214	1381182178	2013-10-07 21:42:58 UTC	467		08890952	qqwet	qqwet	Italia Startup Visa	209	1421297752	2015-01-15 04:55:52 UTC	212		08606879	diggan	diggan	Why Is Google Blocking Inbox on Firefox?	208	1415969609	2014-11-14 12:53:29 UTC	213		010102925	nkzednan	nkzednan	Trucks Are Killing Us	240	1440261460	2015-08-22 16:37:40 UTC	213		06364044	eltondegeneres	eltondegeneres	Free Software Foundation issues statement on new iPhone models from Apple	236	1378852602	2013-09-10 22:36:42 UTC	214		06249815	Sami_Lehtinen	Sami_Lehtinen	"We Need To Talk, Google"	234	1377089481	2013-08-21 12:51:21 UTC	470		06357317	Anechoic	Anechoic	To my daughter's high school programming teacher	578	1378774511	2013-09-10 00:55:11 UTC	726		02857424	ams1	ams1	Jonathan's Card	219	1312743710	2011-08-07 19:01:50 UTC	726		05363290	pg	pg	Official Hacker News T-Shirt	313	1363109072	2013-03-12 17:24:32 UTC	471		07097254	jl	jl	Announcing the Female Founders Conference (March 1)	275	1390329648	2014-01-21 18:40:48 UTC	216		07485991	jgillich	jgillich	Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) Final Beta released	203	1395996636	2014-03-28 08:50:36 UTC	216		05304936	eik3_de	eik3_de	Heroku Fucking Console	281	1362153575	2013-03-01 15:59:35 UTC	472		06504645	codebeaker	codebeaker	Time to hand over the reins before Capistrano costs me my youth?	240	1381079615	2013-10-06 17:13:35 UTC	472		09245043	xvirk	xvirk	"Java is Pass-by-Value, Dammit"	243	1426986541	2015-03-22 01:09:01 UTC	218		05831491	Libertatea	Libertatea	Are coders worth it?	305	1370513215	2013-06-06 10:06:55 UTC	730		05629255	sverrejoh	sverrejoh	My former employer Opera Software has filed a lawsuit against me	232	1367274193	2013-04-29 22:23:13 UTC	475		-16901442	stephenconnolly	stephenconnolly	About PayPal's Node vs Java â€œfightâ€ù	208	1386953176	2013-12-13 16:46:16 UTC	220		-14442710	bookwormAT	bookwormAT	Apple's New Pinch-To-Zoom Monopoly is Bad News	222	1346143689	2012-08-28 08:48:09 UTC	220		02684406	yarapavan	yarapavan	My Life as an Undocumented Immigrant	323	1308766913	2011-06-22 18:21:53 UTC	476		03798171	nickbilton	nickbilton	Google Begins Testing Its Augmented Reality Glasses	288	1333555546	2012-04-04 16:05:46 UTC	477	"On Wednesday, Google gave people 20/20 vision about a secret augmented-reality project called Project Glass.

If you look around on job boards, there simply is not much competition for entry-level talent. Most of the job growth appears to be in academic stuff like AI and data science which requires at the very least a BS and probably an MS. The run-of-the-mill web and mobile developer positions all demand at least some level of experience (generally 2-6 years). It just doesn&#x27;t seem like there is enough demand for inexperienced talent to make this kind of program effective.<p>But if the stats that these bootcamps throw out are true, there are companies hiring people at $100k who, twelve weeks ago, had never opened a text editor in their lives.<p>If you&#x27;ve hired from one of these programs, what made you turn to them? Was it a success? And if it&#x27;s really possible to build a rails developer from scratch in 10 weeks, why not just just do it in-house through an internship program and avoid paying commission to these schools?

The problem was not due to the new server.  In fact the cause was embarrassingly stupid.<p>On a comment thread, a new user had posted some replies as siblings instead of children.  I posted a comment explaining how HN worked. But then I decided to just fix it for him by doing some surgery in the repl.  Unfortunately I used the wrong id for one of the comments and created a loop in the comment tree; I caused an item to be its own grandchild.  After which, when anyone tried to view the thread, the server would try to generate an infinitely long page.  The story in question was on the frontpage, so this happened a lot.<p>For some reason I didn't check the comments after the surgery to see if they were in the right place. I must have been distracted by something.  So I didn't notice anything was wrong till a bit later when the server seemed to be swamped.<p>When I tailed the logs to see what was going on, the pattern looked a lot like what happens when HN runs short of memory and starts GCing too much.  Whether it was that or something else, such problems can usually be fixed by restarting HN.  So that's what I did.  But first, since I had been writing code that day, I pushed the latest version to the server.  As long as I was going to have to restart HN, I might as well get a fresh version.<p>After I restarted HN, the problem was still there.  So I guessed the problem must be due to something in the code I'd written that day, and tried reverting to the previous version, and restarting the server again.  But the problem was still there.  Then we (because by this point I'd managed to get hold of Nick Sivo, YC's hacker in residence) tried reverting to the version of HN that was on the old server, and that didn't work either.  We knew that code had worked fine, so we figured the problem must be with the new server.  So we tried to switch back to the old server.  I don't know if Nick succeeded, because in the middle of this I gave up and went to bed.<p>When I woke up this morning, Rtm had HN running on the new server. The bad thread was still there, but it had been pushed off the frontpage by newer stuff.  So HN as a whole wasn't dying, but there were still signs something was amiss, e.g.  that /threads?id=pg didn't work, because of the comment I made on the thread with the loop in it.<p>Eventually Rtm noticed that the problem seemed to be related to a certain item id.  When I looked at the item on disk I realized what must have happened.<p>So I did some more surgery in the repl, this time more carefully, and everything seems fine now.<p>Sorry about that."	02831646	whoishiring	whoishiring	Ask HN: Who is Hiring?

I used to read about 50-60 pages per day in my commute to high school (about half hour each way). Even though I commute more now (1&#38;half hour each way) and that too in a much more comfortable bus, I had started reading less. So at the start of this semester(its mostly ended now) I (re)started reading.<p>I completed the Foundation series and the last two novels of Paulo Coelho. Other than that I completed Makers and FTW. Both were fun. Right now I am reading two books simultaneously (they both require different kind of attention so its no biggie), they are Godel Escher Bach (funny story how I got it, but that would be a big tangent here) and The Elements of Computing systems.<p>What are you reading right now?"	08453995	milen	milen	Mac App Store: The Subtle Exodus	245	1413302274	2014-10-14 15:57:54 UTC	335		06179240	tptacek	tptacek	Why I Changed My Mind On Weed	363	1375973300	2013-08-08 14:48:20 UTC	591		05073439	jevanish	jevanish	What I wish I knew before moving to San Francisco	558	1358439880	2013-01-17 16:24:40 UTC	592		07353763	rivert	rivert	Please reconsider the Boolean evaluation of midnight	208	1394115684	2014-03-06 14:21:24 UTC	337		08137815	adambratt	adambratt	Navdy: HUD for your car	215	1407256872	2014-08-05 16:41:12 UTC	337		09604203	astoilkov	astoilkov	Show HN: An Isomorphic JavaScript Framework Faster Than React	253	1432642189	2015-05-26 12:09:49 UTC	337		010295658	adrow	adrow	Amazon Flex	460	1443527605	2015-09-29 11:53:25 UTC	593		07463671	snupples	snupples	Why I like Java	425	1395718608	2014-03-25 03:36:48 UTC	339		16135833	tjaerv	tjaerv	NSA director heckled on stage at Black Hat security conference	208	1375295212	2013-07-31 18:26:52 UTC	339		15544010	nullspace	nullspace	Indiaâ€™s elites have a ferocious sense ofÂ entitlement	240	1365876253	2013-04-13 18:04:13 UTC	339		-19936662	randomname2	randomname2	"NASAâ€™s Kepler Mission Discovers Bigger, Older Cousin to Earth"	294	1437667877	2015-07-23 16:11:17 UTC	851		09422033	frewsxcv	frewsxcv	Project Fi by Google	581	1429723952	2015-04-22 17:32:32 UTC	1107		04259441	gasull	gasull	Whistleblower Binney says the NSA has dossiers on nearly every US citizen	223	1342587973	2012-07-18 05:06:13 UTC	340		08996003	mparramon	mparramon	Testosterone is the drug of the future	297	1423042543	2015-02-04 09:35:43 UTC	341		07470097	bpierre	bpierre	Virtual Reality is going to change the world	210	1395790069	2014-03-25 23:27:49 UTC	597		08493849	stoey	stoey	FTDI driver kills fake FTDI FT232s	306	1413999160	2014-10-22 17:32:40 UTC	342		-16740652	callum85	callum85	Jeremy Hammond sentenced to 10 years for Stratfor leak	237	1384536007	2013-11-15 17:20:07 UTC	342		-11755748	edw519	edw519	Wife-beating and slavery were once acceptable: How will the future judge us?	203	1286203126	2010-10-04 14:38:46 UTC	87		05309866	tlogan	tlogan	Evernote hacked	210	1362240499	2013-03-02 16:08:19 UTC	343		06066037	conductor	conductor	"Wine 1.6 Released With 10,000 Changes"	242	1374177131	2013-07-18 19:52:11 UTC	343		09075945	sunils34	sunils34	Stripe: Bitcoin	368	1424371315	2015-02-19 18:41:55 UTC	855		03086793	pjhyett	pjhyett	Time to fork the FSF	323	1318040031	2011-10-08 02:13:51 UTC	345		05893505	ca98am79	ca98am79	Monday was my 46th birthday and likely my last	200	1371480806	2013-06-17 14:53:26 UTC	345		13445664	johns	johns	Why I Hate Android	202	1326169350	2012-01-10 04:22:30 UTC	345		06214553	chinchang	chinchang	JavaScript right on the hardware	313	1376517061	2013-08-14 21:51:01 UTC	346		04712924	cleverjake	cleverjake	"Nexus: The best of Google, now in three sizes"	456	1351527098	2012-10-29 16:11:38 UTC	603		18681043	whoishiring	whoishiring	Ask HN: Who wants to be hired?

The HN community has been a great source of inspiration&#x2F;education and we&#x27;re proud to share our progress. We recently reached the #1 &quot;Top Rated&quot; rank in Mattresses and #2 in Furniture on Amazon.com.<p>Website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tuftandneedle.com&#x2F; Amazon.com: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;top-rated&#x2F;home-garden&#x2F;3732961&#x2F;<p>Problem: Painful shopping experience and extremely high margins in the mattress industry.<p>Solution: We make a good bed without any gimmicks. It is comfortable, safe and attractive without falsely advertised features or fraudulent discounts.<p>Business: We launched with a MVP and a simple landing page to test our ideas. Then about 4 months ago, we listed on Amazon and it&#x27;s caught up to be a significant sales channel on its own. In the last quarter we&#x27;ve had 100% month-over-month growth. We don&#x27;t spend on advertising, and more than half our sales are from word-of-mouth referrals and social media.<p>Technical: We take a pragmatic approach with everything including the storefront, sales tools, inventory tracking and fulfillment processes. We use 3rd-party services for payments (Stripe), bitcoin (Coinbase), shipping labels (EasyPost), CRM (Intercom), etc. Stack: Rails+AngularJS+Heroku.<p>Lesson Learned: Our primary success factor was starting with a rough draft. We didn&#x27;t like our v1 muchâ€”an all cotton tufted mattressâ€”but that didn&#x27;t keep us from launching with it. This gave us a chance to experiment with problem&#x2F;solution and to start collecting feedback right away. We had to do quite a few returns at first but we iterated constantly until our customer satisfaction was high enough for us to start getting referrals.<p>We would really value the community&#x27;s opinion.

However, he went the developer path these past decades instead of moving on to something more &#x27;senior oriented&#x27; such as being a project manager.<p>He has been always learning new stuff, so right now he has a MongoDB certification and is totally fluent in Django. But most of the companies he applies to just see his age and step back. And I&#x27;m also worried because here in Spain large companies are seeing the crisis and the really high youth unemployment as an opportunity to hire youngsters under really poor conditions, and they can actually hire five young developers for the price of one senior dev.<p>So I&#x27;m not really sure how I can help him, I actually know a lot of people in the startup ecosystem but startups usually want people in their 20s and 30s. I have also read a lot of posts regarding &#x27;old developers&#x27;, and he has read them as well.<p>He has a fresh mindset, wants to move to another city&#x2F;country if it&#x27;s required, and has tons of experience, so it&#x27;s very hard for me to see him having this tough time...

I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for \Sr. Developers\"", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume. Here is how I am represented in the email (paraphrased from actual text, ):<p>Given: X &#62; 7 &#38; Y &#62; 4,<p>\""Sr. Level Developer, with X years exp. Y years of prof exp with Ruby. Main expertise is in Ruby, API's, MySQL and a bunch of other stuff. Previously worked for 'ABC' startup ($X Millions angel backed) for two years and helped build out the entire app/platform etc. Later served as CTO for several side projects. I attended Top Tier University , ...  blah blah blah\""<p>More stats:<p>Salary expectations: $115K<p>Areas of interest: API's, Analytics, SaaS, Telephony, Machine learning ....<p>Ability to relocate: Open to idea, can't right away<p>Telecommuter?: Pretty please<p>Snark level: Not nearly as high as this post ;)<p>Likeability: Very high<p>So out of ~50 companies that I tried contacting what was the result?<p>10/50 - sent me a reply email of some sort (confirmation, autoreply, whatever)<p>7/50 - tried to setup a phone screen<p>5/50 - actually completed the phone screen (with all phones screens going very well, I might add)<p>3/50 - tried to setup a technical interview<p>0/50 - actually completed a technical interview<p>0/50 - made offer!<p>From my 60 day simple experiment, I argue......<p>The top 5 reasons you are (probably) not hiring:<p>1. You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through!  LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me \""when can we setup an interview?\"", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying \""Ok how about next week?\"". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>\""Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!\"" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like \""Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc\"". If you think of \""Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!\"" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting"""	010004678	FiloSottile	FiloSottile	Show HN: My SSH server knows who you are	245	1438707793	2015-08-04 17:03:13 UTC	836		08951509	sgloutnikov	sgloutnikov	Facebook was down	265	1422339428	2015-01-27 06:17:08 UTC	325		05897301	virtualpants	virtualpants	Buying the new MacBook Air	270	1371524987	2013-06-18 03:09:47 UTC	325		02155654	georgecmu	georgecmu	Scott Adams: How to Tax the Rich	343	1296317943	2011-01-29 16:19:03 UTC	325		03817840	hunterowens	hunterowens	Facebook acquires Instagram	374	1333990922	2012-04-09 17:02:02 UTC	837		05637663	whoishiring	whoishiring	Ask HN: Who is hiring?

I inspected its 2.x .NET source code today and quickly noticed the following issues which I find quite concerning:<p>The kdbx database is encrypted with AES in CBC&#x2F;PKCS7 mode <i>without</i> proper authentication. HMAC is nowhere to be found in the code, other than when used for sha1-totp. There are SHA2 hashes that seem to guard the integrity of ciphertext, while these might catch a typical file corruption they will not prevent malicious tampering. Even if the hashes are used prior to encryption, that&#x27;s still MtE - not EtM.<p>KeePass likely does not have an online threat model, so attacks like Padding-Oracle might not be applicable, but a lack of AEAD is IMHO highly concerning because it indicates that the author(s) are winging it when it comes to doing crypto right.<p>Byte array comparisons are done with this function from MemUtil.cs:<p><pre><code>		public static bool ArraysEqual(byte[] x, byte[] y) 		{ 			&#x2F;&#x2F; Return false if one of them is null (not comparable)! 			if((x == null) || (y == null)) { Debug.Assert(false); return false; } 			if(x.Length != y.Length) return false; 			for(int i = 0; i &lt; x.Length; ++i) 			{ 				if(x[i] != y[i]) return false; 			} 			return true; 		} </code></pre> There are many other questionable patterns, code smells, and &quot;I-invented-it&quot; approaches that indicate a non-expert .NET programming skill. They can&#x27;t even implement a Singleton correctly (see CryptoRandom.cs).<p>Has anyone ever done a security audit of KeePass 2.x or does everyone just believe that it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot;?<p>P.S. None of this detracts from the fact that KeePass is a very useful, free utility with a lot of effort put into it. I thank all contributors for making&#x2F;improving it over the years."	-11786930	khandelwal	khandelwal	Ask HN: Best Developer Linux Laptop?	272	1286975130	2010-10-13 13:05:30 UTC	111	"What's a good laptop to install Linux (Ubuntu) on?

I spent a week working with them before joining. They liked me, and I liked them. I officially joined as the COO. Deal was to work remotely, till we all figured out the visa.<p>And then, suddenly I was told over a â€˜catch-up callâ€™, that they have to rethink the hiring decision because they really needed someone with a different skill set. The conversation was friendly and polite.<p>Now <i>finger snap</i> - just like that â€“ I am out! Specifically, I was politely asked to leave. Its the strangest experience of my life. They keep reiterating that its not performance related. I believe it.<p>The problem is:   - I let all job offers go (I had a few good ones)   - Told my friends&#x2F;family about the job, and that I will be moving to America   - Reached out to all my contacts (including everyone who was trying to hire me) and attempted to sign them up for this YC service   - I reached out to several people (e.g. at Google, FB, Partners at a management consultancy (i.e. my former employers)) asking them for a potential   investment into this company (&quot;Use our personal networks&quot; was a key strategy), some of these helped me find a job that I turned down<p>I like the founders - they are good guys. I may even understand that they need someone else, but personally that has left me with few options and in a bit of a depressed state! For my wife, this was such a huge decision (to join a startup and move to another country), and it was just awkward to convince her first, and give her the news.<p>I am not being very articulate about why this sucks â€“ but any help&#x2F;advice would be awesome. I have a masters in CS, a failed startup and 6 yrs of management consulting behind me.<p>Edit: Thank you. Thank you for the wonderful support and advice. I called my wife and showed her this thread!

If so, my mind is boggled. I was under the impression there is competition for great employees in Silicon Valley.<p>Here in NYC, if I wanted to be very competitive to hire into any vital position with rare skills, I would anticipate a floor on pay of $125k. I don&#x27;t care if that&#x27;s a designer or a developer or a marketer or what ... I just mean anyone working full time who has a good head on their shoulders and some rare skills.<p>And 0.5-1% equity wouldn&#x27;t move the needle much. I mean, if you have a 5 person company and you bring someone in and give them 1% equity, what is their equity relative to the person sitting next to them? IMHO It&#x27;s a joke. Their ownership is purely symbolic, in a relative sense, and it&#x27;s a symbol of how little they own relative to a founder.<p>Am I completely insane?

But then, some days ago, they did it again. The mailing-list is not accessible anymore, not even by me (the admin).<p>There is no way to get support, no way to get in touch with someone at Google. This is really frustrating.

It took me until last year to figure this out, and only thanks to this community. I hardly ever tried - and when I tried, I didn't persist. It has been my goal to start a business since ever I can remember. And yet I never really tried (until last year, which resulted in abysmal failure). Not even something small, like selling stuff online. I was always good at dreaming up new ideas. But never executed on any one of them.<p>Likewise, I have been programming on and off since the age of 17. Unfortunately, I started out with C++. As soon as I hit pointers, I made up my mind that programming was only for people smarter than me. Somehow, I did get back into it a few years later, but I never really became proficient at it. Again, I was good at learning the basics, reading code, messing around with code snippets on the command line. But I never built anything of value.<p>I don't have too much time left. My 20ies are gone. This is my chance to turn the boat around, and realize my goals. So, this is meant as much for the rest of the world as it is meant for myself. Usually, I would have just signed up with yet another anonymous name. Not this time. I want to keep myself honest. I need to break out of my own little word (unfortunately, besides being a loser, I'm also a loner).<p>HN, here I am. My name is Stefan Kueng, I'm 30 years old, based in Switzerland. For better or for worse. This is my last chance to get my life back on track. If anyone else reads this, wish me good luck.<p>[EDIT] Thanks for your all your responses! I really appreciate it. I admit that my post probably was a bit too much drama. Actually, I have been wanting to say what I said for a long time. But I restrained myself, because I didn't want to decrease the signal-to-noise ratio on HN. But this time I felt I just had to.     I'll probably not get to answer to everyone of you tonight. Just once again, a heartfelt thanks to you guys. HN really is a great community.      And yes, I will consider all your advise. But I'm definitely going ahead with my plan to start building stuff - and eventually to start a business. I have long ago made up my mind that I have only one life. I could go the safe route and work a regular 9-to-5 job, perhaps start a family, and lead a long and happy life. Or I could bet everything on something that's far less likely to succeed. Even if I fail and the resulting stress cuts a few years off my life span, it will have been worth it. I have been wanting to start my own business for too long. I just can't let go of it."	-16398650	gcoleman	gcoleman	Don't use Hadoop when your data isn't that big	227	1379417237	2013-09-17 11:27:17 UTC	711		06840437	psychboo	psychboo	I found Prezi's source code	255	1386081094	2013-12-03 14:31:34 UTC	712		08142487	christop	christop	Wikipedia refuses to delete photo taken by monkey	203	1407333798	2014-08-06 14:03:18 UTC	201		-14483710	jenskanis	jenskanis	"Good riddance, PayPal"	261	1346931716	2012-09-06 11:41:56 UTC	713		01827928	cdine	cdine	Firesheep: Easy HTTP session hijacking from within Firefox	341	1287968447	2010-10-25 01:00:47 UTC	714		-15876559	denzil_correa	denzil_correa	PRISM fears give private search engine DuckDuckGo its best week ever	206	1371157332	2013-06-13 21:02:12 UTC	459		-15230585	Lightning	Lightning	Death in Singapore	233	1360994630	2013-02-16 06:03:50 UTC	459		02789311	p4bl0	p4bl0	Anonymous & Lulz Security Statement to the FBI	241	1311253675	2011-07-21 13:07:55 UTC	459		08742486	jonastern	jonastern	Yahoo Starts Prompting Chrome Users to â€œUpgradeâ€ù to Firefox	231	1418415908	2014-12-12 20:25:08 UTC	460		09353998	junto	junto	Ask HN: What are you doing to improve your health?	358	1428671230	2015-04-10 13:07:10 UTC	205	I guess this is aimed more at older devs and admins who have been sitting at their computers for the last 20 years like me.<p>I&#x27;m starting to feel my age.

Out of money and tech co-founder has bailed.	232	1210181458	2008-05-07 17:30:58 UTC	129	"Looking for YC advice:<p>I am the non technical co founder of a startup, which has been in development mode for 12 months. I took a $30,000 loan and raised some $160,000 in funding from friends and an angel to develop an idea to the proof of concept stage. I found a Django technical developer 14 months ago, and initially have paid her $6900 a month and 6% of the company equity to build a decent prototytpe, with an expectation of ratching it up in the longer term. She quoted it would take her 6 months of full time work to do this.<p>4 months into development, she threatened to bail on the project and raise funding for her own startup idea unless I increased her equity stake to 35%. I was initially very upset by this change, as I had been up front and honest from the beginning and I didn't like the idea of switching terms midway through the project. I felt there was an asymmetry in our risk, as I quit my nursing job to do this and raised all the capital. She also refused to take a pay cut in return for the equity. I had limited alternative developer options to leverage in the situation.<p>I eventually agreed because without a proof of concept,I knew we wouldn't make it, and it seemed we were getting close to launch. I thought I would rather have a real partner than a long term contract developer, and adjusted to the concept if both being in it full time. I have taken a 55% pay cut to work on the startup, and have been paying myself $3000 a months, which comes to about $2400 incomes after taxes.<p>12 months later, we have a partially complete web app, have run out of money, and she has bolted back to her contract gigs. She hasn't finished the work to the point where I can do a beta, as the alpha feedback has not been incorporated into the software.<p>She refuses to invest any of her own money into the idea, I don't want to \get a real job\"" because I won't be able to work on the startup idea. I have very little money left in the bank. Raising more capital is really hard, because we haven't executed on our milestones. I refuse to give up on the idea, and I know that the window of opportunity is only a few months.<p>I am considering outsourcing the development  to India, so I can get it to a releasable state. I have the source code and am also considering learning Django from scratch: How hard would that be?<p>Where should I go from here?

Does that make me a bad person?	218	1277546818	2010-06-26 10:06:58 UTC	151	"I don't like Python.<p>I love C. I like C++ too. I used to write a lot of Java when I was a kid (as in high-school kid) but now that I've written quite a bit of C and C++, Java seems more like a toy language. I did enjoy Java back then, however. I yet to do any major work in C#, but it seems to be a powerful language, especially when handling certain kinds of complexity.<p>I've been learning LISP on weekends for two weekends now, and I find it interesting. I know little bits of Haskell (am planning to learn it later this year) and seem to like it too. Maybe I like the idea of liking Haskell, I'll know for sure once I actually start writing Haskell.<p>Coming back to the point - I don't like Python. I've never liked it. I've tried working on various Python projects but have always found some or the other excuse to prematurely back out. And mind you, I love coding - I spend most of my time writing code or learning new stuff about code.<p>My question to the hardcore python lovers is this (and mind you, by hardcore I mean the kind of people who wrote Exaile, not the kind who hack up a Python script every now and then to organize their iPod): No doubt many of you have come from C / C++ / LISP backgrounds. What is the paradigm shift you experienced? I look at a piece of C code in a certain way - how do I look at a piece of Python code? How do I think about Python?

However, this week they sent me an email saying:<p>&quot;Stripe provides a service between banks and our users. In order to provide service to our users, we are urged by our banking partners to keep an eye on all accounts that sign up for our services. We&#x27;ve noticed that you have processed charges that seem to be unauthorized--in order to make charges with credit and debit cards, the owner of the card must consent to the charge. Charges on your account do seem to lack this consent, which unfortunately means that we will no longer be able to offer service&quot;<p>This makes no sense as I have had hundreds of payments and not a single payment has been disputed. So how could it be true that the payments are unauthorised? I have sent Stripe emails explaining this and they will not respond.<p>I am very disappointed. As a member of this community I assumed Stripe would treat developers making a living online with a little more respect. I plan to write a lengthy blog post explaining this in more depth.<p><i>Update: I am currently in contact with Stripe CEO over email. He is dealing with the issue.

What should I do next?	200	1422638267	2015-01-30 17:17:47 UTC	215	"I went in to work this morning, in downtown Cleveland, ordered a BLT for our free lunch friday, and got called into a meeting. I was told my position was being removed (probably to cut costs, although they did not say), and I needed to clean off my desk. I&#x27;m a javascript developer. I built a large angular application while there, but it is now built and there are other developers who can support it.<p>As far as I see it, I have this great opportunity to break out of the regular 9-5 job world, which I have always wanted to do. I have been working weekends on pearmarket.co, which is a website for small farmers to more easily promote their products online (I have recently open sourced the core of the project at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thecolorblue&#x2F;beetpress). Unfortunately, it is not currently in a place where I can dedicate all of my time to it and see any income. I would say I am 3 months of solid work away from having a good beta. I do not see this as an option as it would clear out most of my savings, and leave me in mostly the same position I am in now.<p>I have looked into doing freelance work, but as I am self taught my CS skills are not as solid as other developers, and my design skills are just about average. I am more product focused, I try to work as closely to the end user as possible and clearly define what they need. There does not seem to be a need for freelance product people (is this a good assumption?). It&#x27;s also important to note that I am 28 and just got engaged. Moving is an option, but living on a spare couch for a couple months is not.<p>So I really have two questions. What would you do in my situation (would you stay in a smaller city?), and if you could start over in web development, what would you focus on?"	04898117	mtgx	mtgx	The Pirate Bay Is The Worldâ€™s Most Efficient Public Library	215	1355128987	2012-12-10 08:43:07 UTC	216		06480155	kumarski	kumarski	Children aren't born smart.

What doesn't make it any easier is that I'm 20, I have no college diploma, no high school diploma, no idea what the fuck is going on.<p>I'm an idiot, essentially. This post serves mainly as a warning for those who could be in the same position, contemplating quitting. It's not as much fun as you think. It's not like Office Space. I'm not saying you shouldn't quit, but you should really put more thought into it.<p>And fuck, I even had enough savings for four months after quitting. I thought a lot of things through, includes finances etc. I even managed to live by myself for the entire four months until I finally gave in and couldn't pay the rent.<p>It just didn't work out and it feels very painful."	-18600716	kvargs	kvargs	Letter to Amazon Board from Fired Ad Exec	558	1415872301	2014-11-13 09:51:41 UTC	1257		09292831	somerandomness	somerandomness	â€œToday we moved into our new Facebook buildingâ€ù	449	1427751998	2015-03-30 21:46:38 UTC	234		07533368	ValG	ValG	Show HN: InstaMotor â€“ Taking the pain out of selling your car	208	1396636296	2014-04-04 18:31:36 UTC	234		-15921347	o0-0o	o0-0o	U.S. charges Edward Snowden with espionage	346	1371852991	2013-06-21 22:16:31 UTC	749		-17784868	steveklabnik	steveklabnik	An open letter on feminism in tech	316	1400778261	2014-05-22 17:04:21 UTC	239		02127937	jsm386	jsm386	Google search and search engine spam	212	1295629516	2011-01-21 17:05:16 UTC	239		-13953534	dean	dean	Why I'm thrilled Mark Zuckerberg is annoying the bankers	204	1336658946	2012-05-10 14:09:06 UTC	240		14508873	bane	bane	Depression lies	229	1347418254	2012-09-12 02:50:54 UTC	496		-17021057	bane	bane	The $200 Billion Rip-Off: Our broadband future was stolen (2007)	237	1389142658	2014-01-08 00:57:38 UTC	241		-17558199	anon1385	anon1385	"\OpenSSL has exploit mitigation countermeasures to make sure it's exploitable\"""""	236	1397030759	2014-04-09 08:05:59 UTC	497		08031840	austenallred	austenallred	Net neutrality	252	1405356904	2014-07-14 16:55:04 UTC	497		08291934	benigeri	benigeri	The Apple Watch	836	1410288456	2014-09-09 18:47:36 UTC	501		01712035	spahl	spahl	"Mongrel2 Says, \Goodbye Python\"""""	236	1285063639	2010-09-21 10:07:19 UTC	246		06963365	tomlemon	tomlemon	Google Has Officially Penalized Rap Genius For Link Schemes	283	1387990118	2013-12-25 16:48:38 UTC	502		010357115	luu	luu	Mercury Spill	358	1444346848	2015-10-08 23:27:28 UTC	759		04198271	timmipetit	timmipetit	PHP is much better than what you think	334	1341389326	2012-07-04 08:08:46 UTC	248		17064435	pyduan	pyduan	Nassim Taleb: We should retire the notion of standard deviation	244	1389805372	2014-01-15 17:02:52 UTC	248		-15450691	metajack	metajack	Mozilla and Epic Announce Unreal Engine for the Web	214	1364404923	2013-03-27 17:22:03 UTC	504		02909136	ColinWright	ColinWright	Why Arabic is Terrific	236	1313932751	2011-08-21 13:19:11 UTC	504		04880466	mergy	mergy	IRecognition: I am no longer Apple's Target Market	233	1354772990	2012-12-06 05:49:50 UTC	249	]	02949787	whoishiring	whoishiring	Ask HN: Who is Hiring?

However, I&#x27;m also pretty smart which helps me fake it so that no one else notices. I think part of my problem might be that I grew up with an entitlement complex as I was valedictorian, near perfect SATs etc. and I never did shit in high school.<p>Now that I&#x27;m in the real world it&#x27;s starting to really gnaw at me. I make $130k as a 21 year old and I probably put in 3 hours of real work a day. I&#x27;m a good enough programmer that I can bullshit my way through most stuff and at this point I think people are starting to realize that I&#x27;m a bit slower than I could be. I still push out a lot of code, but I secretly spend 7-8 hours a day doing bullshit at work (reading online, games, etc). I know that I&#x27;ve been given a gift and that I&#x27;m a fucking idiot for wasting it, but I&#x27;ve just become a chronic procrastinator and it sucks.<p>I could be changing the world but instead I&#x27;m putting in the bare minimum and no matter what trick or method I try I can&#x27;t seem to beat it. I&#x27;ve never had a strong willpower to begin with and now it seems to be getting worse (looking back I wish I played more sports).<p>Any advice on how you taught yourself to focus on tasks, build willpower, and get shit done would be helpful. Although, I wonder if I really fucked my brain&#x2F;habits up so much that I&#x27;ll never reach my full capacity. I&#x27;ve been like this for the past 6-7 years and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be going away anytime soon. My dad is also very similar in that he&#x27;s smart enough to bullshit through life but he only works at 10-20% of his full capacity and he never completes anything.<p>Help!?"	-12247560	epall	epall	Money Wonâ€™t Buy You Health Insurance	423	1298327214	2011-02-21 22:26:54 UTC	596		03882268	peteforde	peteforde	"Asteroid Mining Venture Backed by Google Execs, James Cameron Unveiled"	211	1335238071	2012-04-24 03:27:51 UTC	341		06068323	VexXtreme	VexXtreme	The Forbidden Island	278	1374207820	2013-07-19 04:23:40 UTC	597		01100377	unignorant	unignorant	Microsoftâ€™s Creative Destruction 	235	1265288299	2010-02-04 12:58:19 UTC	342		05947584	cgilmer	cgilmer	"Pandora Paid Over $1,300 for 1 Million Plays"	209	1372268530	2013-06-26 17:42:10 UTC	599		05935731	salimmadjd	salimmadjd	USA must not hunt down whistleblower Edward Snowden	237	1372108497	2013-06-24 21:14:57 UTC	344		05636586	comex	comex	Florida Teen Charged With Felony After Science Experiment Goes Bad	245	1367385535	2013-05-01 05:18:55 UTC	345		08110144	keso	keso	Announcing a specification for PHP	256	1406745600	2014-07-30 18:40:00 UTC	346		06956658	jmarbach	jmarbach	RapGenius Growth Hack Exposed	215	1387834656	2013-12-23 21:37:36 UTC	347		09395217	TheMissingPiece	TheMissingPiece	RethinkDB 2.0 is amazing	203	1429286881	2015-04-17 16:08:01 UTC	348		18689231	tosh	tosh	24/192 music downloads are silly	424	1417548426	2014-12-02 19:27:06 UTC	604		-15305055	nelstrom	nelstrom	Vim users: stop using hjkl	211	1362154491	2013-03-01 16:14:51 UTC	93		03428984	teaspoon	teaspoon	Why 37signals Doesn't Hire Programmers Based on Brainteasers	423	1325776942	2012-01-05 15:22:22 UTC	605		03597025	Maxious	Maxious	Jotform domain seized by US due to user generated content	236	1329356707	2012-02-16 01:45:07 UTC	605		05224616	SuccintWork	SuccintWork	Meteorite crash in Russia	295	1360906279	2013-02-15 05:31:19 UTC	862		07367243	kewball	kewball	Ask HN: Successful one-person online businesses?	286	1394333570	2014-03-09 02:52:50 UTC	351	How many people on hacker news are running successful<i></i> online businesses on their own?

Call me.\""<p>Guys, this kind of email does not get you hired. It will especially not get you hired when your LinkedIn profile is set to super private and the only thing I see is your picture. Even worse is when you don't even bother to send an email to the poster directly and it's instead just BCC all the emails in the Who's Hiring thread. And even worse is when you apply for a position that's not even the one being offered. Take the time to actually read the posts: just because a listing contains the word \""developer\"" does not mean it's a <i>software</i> developer. Business Developer != Software Developer!<p>Some friendly advice: if you at least click on the links in the posts, take a look at the startups' sites, and just mention in your email \""I see your product/service X, and think it's interesting\"" the value of your email and the chances of getting contacted in regards to the job shoot up infinitely more.<p>HN Who's Hiring is not CraigsList. It's mainly quality people posting because they know there are quality readers looking to get hired. Put a tiny bit of effort into the emails you throw out, it's an investment that will pay back greatly! Remember, this is the first impression you are making on someone who might be your future employer! You're often not dealing with HR staff/agencies, and will be likely directly in touch with the person you'll be working with/for should you be hired. Show some effort, make it look like you at least care.<p>Yes, it's not easy to sit there and read about each of the companies and what they're working on, but it is a hirers' market and if you don't show the initiative and stick out as someone who is earnest about becoming a valuable member of the team, why would anyone bother replying? Especially when startups are looking for the top talent (whether they need it or not is besides the point), HN is full of A-list developers/founders and A-listers only hire other A-listers. Your \""meh, here's my info, you do the research about me and if you're interested call me up\"" is not the kind of attitude that inspires confidence and will not get you a job.<p>I know for a fact that HN is chock-full of quality talent both hiring and looking to be hired. It is sad that this is the sort of response people posting job listings have been getting. For the sake of the entire community, put a little bit of effort into your email shots. It's better (and is a smarter investment) to look through the listings, get a feel for what companies are working on stuff that would interest you, and spend a couple of hours drafting 10 personalized emails explaining why <i>you</i> are the answer to the question than to simply ctrl+f \""developer\"", ctrl+c, bcc, ctrl+v, rinse, repeat, send.<p>tl;dr if it'll take the company more effort to reply to your email than you put into sending it, you're doing it wrong."""	010083536	panarky	panarky	The Ashley Madison Database Was Leaked	506	1439955117	2015-08-19 03:31:57 UTC	363		03871846	dshipper	dshipper	This Is 2016 Not 2012	231	1335018796	2012-04-21 14:33:16 UTC	364		04585223	j4mie	j4mie	A Letter from Tim Cook on Maps	486	1348836795	2012-09-28 12:53:15 UTC	620		04488561	steeleduncan	steeleduncan	A proposal for improving HN : it should cost a user Karma to post	268	1347017655	2012-09-07 11:34:15 UTC	365		19235002	rjshade	rjshade	Elon Musk: Tesla cars will have â€œautopilot modeâ€ù by summer	244	1426804165	2015-03-19 22:29:25 UTC	365		09960730	vkb	vkb	Who's doing this to my internet?	293	1438083451	2015-07-28 11:37:31 UTC	366		06129379	hvs	hvs	"Now That Itâ€™s in the Broadband Game, Google Flip-Flops on Network Neutrality"	204	1375212279	2013-07-30 19:24:39 UTC	366		08675952	sethbannon	sethbannon	Hard-won lessons about money and investing	248	1417320464	2014-11-30 04:07:44 UTC	366		05337558	shawndumas	shawndumas	Unix tricks	224	1362664731	2013-03-07 13:58:51 UTC	623		-13528138	ColinWright	ColinWright	US bars friends over Twitter joke	215	1327918805	2012-01-30 10:20:05 UTC	368		15176140	kirkus	kirkus	"Employees leave managers, not companies"	257	1360156318	2013-02-06 13:11:58 UTC	625		08963658	Alex3917	Alex3917	What Silicon Valley Thinks of Women	230	1422492607	2015-01-29 00:50:07 UTC	114		06373899	danso	danso	Pushed to the limit as a banking intern	219	1378993286	2013-09-12 13:41:26 UTC	118		03852341	yummyfajitas	yummyfajitas	"A High Frequency Trader's Apologia, Part 1"	317	1334667854	2012-04-17 13:04:14 UTC	375		06861533	wikiburner	wikiburner	People Donâ€™t Actually Like Creativity	214	1386343930	2013-12-06 15:32:10 UTC	375		07469829	sethbannon	sethbannon	Minecraft creator says heâ€™s canceled talks for Oculus Rift version	351	1395787804	2014-03-25 22:50:04 UTC	887		-17738194	jlongster	jlongster	"Removing User Interface Complexity, or Why React is Awesome"	219	1399990083	2014-05-13 14:08:03 UTC	632		03744237	nwienert	nwienert	Codename: Obtvse	355	1332493345	2012-03-23 09:02:25 UTC	889		09646065	denzil_correa	denzil_correa	FBI operating fleet of surveillance aircraft flying over US cities	217	1433255345	2015-06-02 14:29:05 UTC	379		-17605687	gary_bernhardt	gary_bernhardt	The Birth and Death of JavaScript [video]	227	1397761993	2014-04-17 19:13:13 UTC	635		04630057	ryanstewart	ryanstewart	The State of JavaScript - Brendan Eich	260	1349759180	2012-10-09 05:06:20 UTC	380		09730570	wnm	wnm	DuckDuckGo on CNBC: Weâ€™ve grown 600% since NSA surveillance news broke	245	1434529242	2015-06-17 08:20:42 UTC	636		-19898502	gwintrob	gwintrob	Ellen Pao: The Trolls Are Winning the Battle for the Internet	243	1437066928	2015-07-16 17:15:28 UTC	125		09712267	networked	networked	Why did Borland fail?	261	1434223464	2015-06-13 19:24:24 UTC	381		-18582985	alandarev	alandarev	All cameras are police cameras	220	1415618928	2014-11-10 11:28:48 UTC	383		07218913	crassus	crassus	Widespread sex differences in gene expression in the human brain (2013)	201	1392140503	2014-02-11 17:41:43 UTC	129		06672029	shrikant	shrikant	The Monster Truck Madness 2 site is unchanged from 1998	235	1383608872	2013-11-04 23:47:52 UTC	385		01814613	tomeast	tomeast	Apple deprecates Java	268	1287646682	2010-10-21 07:38:02 UTC	386		05018560	shrikant	shrikant	Power surges in Britain caused by millions of people making tea [video]	275	1357519757	2013-01-07 00:49:17 UTC	386		07390736	nitai	nitai	Why you might not want to incorporate in the USA	350	1394702157	2014-03-13 09:15:57 UTC	386		04105325	ichilton	ichilton	New Apple Macbook Pro RAM is soldered to the motherboard | Ian Chilton	310	1339586901	2012-06-13 11:28:21 UTC	131		04541871	spearo77	spearo77	The iPhone 5	205	1348024514	2012-09-19 03:15:14 UTC	131		06033567	Lisa2000	Lisa2000	I understood gender discrimination once I added â€œMr.â€ù to my resume	376	1373647362	2013-07-12 16:42:42 UTC	643	"&quot;I made one change that day.

Obviously your answer is going to be contingent on the kind of work that you do.<p>Some background: What&#x27;s motivating me to ask is that I am flirting with the idea of trying to add a couple of features to SlickGrid (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mleibman&#x2F;SlickGrid), Michael Leibman&#x27;s phenomenal javascript grid widget. Unfortunately Leibman got busy and isn&#x27;t actively supporting it anymore.<p>The codebase is something like 8k lines of javascript, so it&#x27;s not ludicrously big, but I&#x27;m kind of intimidated thinking about trying to make sense of it. My first strategy is just to open up important-looking javascript files (slick.core.js, slick.grid.js) and read through for comprehension. This seems like a pretty slow way to build a mental model of the code, though. Some features I want to implement are 1. an ajax data source that doesn&#x27;t require paging, and 2. frozen columns. Someone else has implemented a buggy version of frozen columns (and since abandoned the project), and I might like to use it, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s buggy because it&#x27;s a hard problem, or because their implementation strategy was poor (or both!). So at the moment I can&#x27;t evaluate if I should implement my own, or try to fix the issues with theirs.<p>Picking up other people&#x27;s code seems to be one of the harder tasks developers face, as evidenced by how much code gets abandoned, so I wondered if the voices of experience on here could point me in the right direction, either by talking about this problem in particular, or more generally, how you build knowledge about a new codebase.<p>Thanks!"	06646936	mercurial	mercurial	Mysterious Mac and PC malware that jumps airgaps?	245	1383229425	2013-10-31 14:23:45 UTC	407		03884720	jganetsk	jganetsk	"Introducing Google Drive... yes, really"	492	1335285207	2012-04-24 16:33:27 UTC	663		09389520	67726e	67726e	Why Young Men Go to War	214	1429206280	2015-04-16 17:44:40 UTC	152		04767789	dendory	dendory	The amount of crap Windows users have to put up with is incredible	322	1352582756	2012-11-10 21:25:56 UTC	408		-17062489	jorrizza	jorrizza	Blackphone	204	1389779728	2014-01-15 09:55:28 UTC	408		09242379	rayalez	rayalez	Ask HN: Do you take nootropics?	219	1426934949	2015-03-21 10:49:09 UTC	155	What do you think about them?<p>Which ones do you take?	07254988	ChrisBland	ChrisBland	"By The Time You Give Them a Raise, Theyâ€™re Already Out The Door"	372	1392676594	2014-02-17 22:36:34 UTC	412		09127232	whoishiring	whoishiring	Ask HN: Who is hiring?

Ranging from the theoretical, say discrete mathematics, to the practical, starting a business.<p>All of these different topics, when made accessible immediately and in most cases for free or at a little cost (libraries, MOOCs, youtube videos, books, etc), result in a sort of &quot;information paralysis&quot;. There&#x27;s too much to do, too easily, and I end up doing nothing.<p>This really got my attention yesterday morning when I was watching an Algorithms lecture, and my girlfriend pointed out that the lecturer looked familiar. That&#x27;s because I had watched the same lecture 12 months ago and she caught a glimpse then also.<p>I could have done the course twice over, if I had stuck with it and not gotten distracted. But I didn&#x27;t, and 12 months later I know nothing more than I did back then about this subject. This scares me.<p>This scares me especially because I&#x27;m at the start of a 4-5 month stretch where I absolutely need to cover 4 highly technical subjects, on my own and unguided, to continue my studies. (Details omitted for brevity)<p>I&#x27;ve faced this dilemma before and tried to tackle it on my own, and failed. So I&#x27;m posting here in the hops that some other students &#x2F; professionals have encountered a similar problem and found a solution.

All my life, I&#x27;ve struggled with procrastination. I find it very hard to sit down and work on a project without an external motivator, and on many nights I end up vegging out in front of the TV or aimlessly clicking around on the internet. As a result, even though I am successful on an absolute scale â€” CS degree from a top-10, worked at a startup and a large company, enough savings to last a few years of solo development â€” by my own metric of success, I am crippled by the feeling that it&#x27;s &quot;too late&quot;. Every day, I read an article by some hot-shot young dev who has a handful of fancy projects behind his belt (not to mention a great website and design sensibility) while I have exactly zero â€” and he&#x27;s half a decade younger than me! How will I ever be able to catch up? Experience-wise, I&#x27;m still a junior dev.<p>It&#x27;s a constant, irrepressible gnawing in my chest. Every morning, I take tally of my age. Whenever I encounter a technical article, I immediately and compulsively investigate the author&#x27;s age. If I&#x27;m behind â€” which I always am â€” I will lock myself in my room and force myself to work, even though I still end up on HN half the time. It&#x27;s exhausting and terrifying, but I also don&#x27;t want to loosen up. At my core, I am intensely ambitious. I have so many great ideas, and knowing that the main obstacle between them and me is only myself keeps me in an endless state of panic.<p>It&#x27;s been getting better. For the first time in my life, my procrastination is starting to get tamed. I&#x27;ve been working hard on my first big project, and I expect it&#x27;s going to be a great one.

Even though it was termed an acquisition, it was really an acqui-hire. When people congratulate me on that, I know in my heart that it&#x27;s not true and it doesn&#x27;t really make me happy.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve quit my job at that company because I just couldn&#x27;t work there any longer. And am trying to figure out what to do next.<p>I know for a fact that I want to run my own business and attain financial freedom but I can&#x27;t risk another startup at this moment because: 1. Startups are tough and I am afraid 2. I have a few financial responsibilities towards my family which I have to take care of.<p>Thus, I have picked up another job which I&#x27;ll join in a few weeks. It is not in a very &#x27;sexy&#x27; or &#x27;trendy&#x27; industry and I have no idea where it is going to take me in two years.<p>What do you do when you believe that you can do great things but something that you have no control over is holding you back? You believe that you are good at what you do and are meant for great things but you have to do your job even though it doesn&#x27;t do justice to your capabilities. How do you cope with that? Seeing your future as an underachiever pains you. What do you do?<p>In the course of trying to figure it out, I spoke to my friends about this,  I realised that most of them are going through the same thing. But they haven&#x27;t figured out how to deal with it. I don&#x27;t know if this is what they call a quarter-life crisis.<p>Thus, this is as much a distress call as it is a rant. And not having anyone else to turn to, I am posting it here at HN assuming that this is not just a problem for a handful of people but a general problem for people who believe in their ability to do great things (whether it is true or not is irrelevant to them).<p>The questions I posed here aren&#x27;t the only ones I have in my mind.

I used to wake up and do the grim commute each morning to London from my home and the only thing that made it vaguely ok was Hacker News. It was a great place to go and find interesting articles from genuinely passionate people. It also used to be a really safe place to launch a startup that you'd spent days, weeks, years on - your project. It was a place where you could launch your startup and know you'd get great constructive feedback. People may not necessarily like your site but they'd admire you for having the balls to launch it, for spending time developing something that you hoped could benefit people in some way. They'd want you to succeed and they'd try and help you succeed with feedback that would ultimately help you. Unfortunately, today's Hacker News audience is no longer the same. Today's Hacker News is a place where users want to snipe at other users and find negative aspects to anything thing submitted. No longer does someone say 'This and this I like but this needs work'. Oh no, now the response is 'Hate this, hate that, this is pointless.'. Hacker News now is about correcting grammar and points scoring. It is pointing out anything negative at all that anyone has done, has said. It is no longer a safe place. It has fast become an acidic forum.<p>I've launched 2 projects (11kclub and Favilous) on here over the last year - both got a similar response. There was nothing constructive, it was just sniping - they saw someone had put themselves up there and they just shot them down. It's a real shame. I hope one day the site returns with the kind of audience it once had. Until that happens, I won't be going on my favourite site anymore - the commute just got a whole lot longer.<p>For now I wish you all the best...<p>Thanks<p>Steve"	-18741868	dennyferra	dennyferra	Can a simple algebra test predict programming aptitude?	212	1418409335	2014-12-12 18:35:35 UTC	104		06013989	gigq	gigq	"Seth Vidal, creator of yum, killed in hit and run accident"	397	1373392033	2013-07-09 17:47:13 UTC	360		-19698870	1wheel	1wheel	What Is Code?	354	1434020566	2015-06-11 11:02:46 UTC	1384		0875686	vips	vips	Ask HN: Please name two of your most favorite books.	227	1255310912	2009-10-12 01:28:32 UTC	105	Mine are  Pixar Touch and IWOZ	19113643	aaronbrethorst	aaronbrethorst	The birth of Microsoft's new web rendering engine	234	1424971213	2015-02-26 17:20:13 UTC	361		08016055	danielsamuels	danielsamuels	Why is Netflix Buffering?

Given how important software is, then, you'd expect computer programmer - the task of developing and maintaining software - to be one of the highest-paid, most-wanted jobs. It isn't. Why not?<p>\Hold on\"", you say, \""isn't programming a high-paying job\""? Sure, next to the average American worker. But the average American worker is a college dropout. What if you compare programming to jobs for other highly skilled professionals?<p>Consider a 35-year-old, senior Google engineer. He probably makes about $150,000, which is enough to buy a good house and raise a family. But Google wouldn't hire a random guy to fill that job - this engineer probably has an Ivy League or other elite degree, fifteen years of work experience, a very high IQ, strong drive, and numerous other skills (anyone who's been through the Google hiring process can tell you how hard it is to get in).<p>As a doctor, however, someone like this - a top professional at the peak of their career - would probably make about $400,000. Partners at big law firms commonly net a million a year. Investment bankers are making several million (post-crash!). Top management consultants easily clear $500,000. Even a top accountant - probably a partner at a big 4 firm - would make two, three, or four times as much.<p>Of course, life isn't all about money. Is programming a top job from a social perspective? Again, no. Congress includes not a single programmer, and to my knowledge, it never has. Almost all big companies are run by MBAs. Even Microsoft, arguably the canonical software company, is run by a non-programmer from Stanford Business School.<p>Are programmers top government advisors? Are they national heroes? Do doctors and lawyers and policemen tell their children that, if they work hard and practice, one day they can grow up to be a programmer? No. Obviously not.<p>When the government wants to bring in more workers from overseas - which obviously lowers salaries, and reduces job security - who do they bring in? Computer programmers. Every single one of the top ten H1-B visa users is a technology company. Politicians justify this by talking about a \""shortage\"" of programmers, but would there really be a \""shortage\"" if programmers were paid $500K, as much as doctors or management consultants? Of course not. Saying there's a \""shortage\"" is economically the same as saying that \""we don't want to pay you guys enough to meet the demand for labor\"".<p>Now, to wrap off, since this is a startup site, doubtless someone is saying \""but programmers can make millions in startups!\"". This, on the face of it, is true. However, as I'm sure any founder here can tell you, you can't make a successful startup just by being a good programmer. You have to, to quote Paul Graham, also \""answer support calls, administer the servers, design the web site, cold-call customers, find the company office space, and go out and get everyone lunch.\""<p>Now, if you're willing to do all that, and work the eighty-hour weeks a business requires, why do you need to be a programmer to make it rich? You don't. There are millions of ordinary small businesses - ditch diggers, electrical companies, contractors, roofers, construction firms, and on and on - that, if run well, will make you millions without a single line of code. (For more on these sorts of business, check out, eg., the book The Millionaire Next Door.) What \""programmers can get rich in startups\"" really means is \""entrepreneurs can get rich in startups\"", whether they're programmers or bricklayers.<p>So, why is this the case, given how important software is to the world? I think the answer is hidden in the rest of my post. Notice how I've been arguing <i>for</i> more pay, job security, etc. for programmers. A majority of the people here are probably programmers. Yet, my tone is pretty argumentative; I expect people to disagree with me, and am trying to answer their objections.<p>Why is that? On the face of it, it's very strange. If you went to a welder's union, and argued that welding wasn't respected enough and should be better paid, you'd expect to see loud cries of agreement. If you talked about better wages for teachers or policemen or nurses - all of whom make more than the American average - who would dispute it?<p>But for some reason, unlike just about every other profession, programmers seem to have an aversion to asking for more pay and more respectability. It would seem selfish, somehow - a programmer making $80,000 feels he shouldn't ask for more, since he's already making double the US average of $40,000. (Even though, when a teacher making $80,000 (as many of them do) asks for more, no one disagrees.) And you could argue that this is selfish, even though it's the sort of selfishness America usually endorses. After all, when the miner's union strikes for better working conditions, aren't they being selfish? They're acting in their own self-interest, trying to benefit themselves.<p>So, if you don't like being selfish, is there a reason to make programming one of America's top jobs? I think there is. For the last ten years, the people running the US have been other, non-technical top professionals - lawyers, management consultants, investment bankers, MBAs. And it hasn't worked. The economy is in the toilet, the budget isn't balanced, the government can't get anything done, we're in two wars we can't get out of, and some days it feels like the country is falling apart at the seams.<p>By contrast, when you look at Silicon Valley, where a lot of the top programmers live and run the local industry, everyone is doing great. Profits are up, unemployment is down, companies are getting started, and user growth is through the roof. Might this be a coincidence? I think it isn't. And for proof, look no further than China. All of China's top leaders are engineers, not lawyers or financiers or consultants. And China's been doing great. They've had steady, 10% annual economic growth - triple the US's, even in good times - for the last thirty years. Sure, they have problems with pollution and corruption, but so did the US when we were industrializing. Overall, though, they're on the right track, and the US is not (according to 85% of Americans anyway).<p>Of course, that isn't to say that most non-programmers are stupid or immoral, or that we shouldn't have any lawyers in government. Any well-run society has a mix of people at the top, because of specialization of labor. But is the optimal number of programmers in Congress really zero? Is it good for the country that Silicon Valley, arguably the best-performing sector of the economy, has next to no influence in politics, so that laws like the DMCA get passed even when the whole hacker community is violently opposed? I think it isn't. I think the country would be better off if MIT computer science students, like their neighbors at Harvard Law School, could dream of growing up to be President. And I think we'd all be better of if computer science wasn't just seen as a major for socially awkward nerds.<p>(Original WSJ editorial I'm referencing at http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html.

I have my own ideas that I love dearly and work on, the first of which will be released for you all to play around with and break at the end of the week, but I <i>never</i> leave HN without feeling that no matter what I do, it will never be as good as what I've just read about.  I have my own skills, I got a BS degree from a decent school in Comp Sci a few years ago, and still I barely work with anything other than LAMP and frontend stuff and frequently find myself having no clue as to what some of the submissions and discussions on this site are about.<p>It affects me on a more personal level than I'd like to admit, but I'll do anyway as a way to get it out of my system and see what you all think.  I'm a lone \founder\"" of several websites that I finished up to 80%, then left to collect dust, and am now tidying up to display on a resume since I'm essentially out of money.  Whenever I come here and read the articles and discussions I feel like my ideas, and myself by extension are absolute shit for several reasons.<p>1) So many talented people here.  I don't know the slightest thing about any other language besides Javascript, PHP, Java (from school), and MySQL.  I'm 25.  I work on a Windows XP box and use an IDE because I like the code completion.  I consider myself damn good at the languages I listed, but I get the impression that people here are damn good at way more than this.<p>2) HN shows me all these people and ideas that are succeeding.  It used to be inspirational, but now it's frightening.  I've always been told I'm a smart kid, and that I'll be a millionaire some day, and all of that shit.  I see these ideas gaining traction, some of which I could never be able to do myself, some of which I could have done overnight, and I see myself staying still.  It's overwhelming.<p>3) There are people that post here that are so smart.  There are people here that can express their ideas so clearly.  There are people here that know so much about so many things.  And there's me... I'm not really able to contribute much.  How am I to believe I'm any good at anything?  If you all are to be my competitors, I should just give up now.<p>At any rate, I'm just curious to see if anybody gets the same feelings of being overwhelmed by the amount of awesomeness that's on this site.

These days you can't necessarily easily get a visa, especially if you're a young startup.<p>So, the question is, what location is the most like SF in all the ways that are beneficial for starting a startup but outside the USA?<p>We're a two person team.  Founders have been together for a decade.  One is engineer with deep experience, other is marketing and design expert. We're already slightly successful with our first product that has pointed the way to the Big Product for us.<p>We can relocate just about anywhere in the world, except the USA.  Our passports will allow us to visit most countries without a visa and we should have little trouble getting work/residency visas in countries that welcome entrepreneurs.<p>So, where's the silicon valley besides silicon valley?<p>We've thought about: Toronto- seems to have a very strong startup scene, but this is just an impression.<p>Bratislava- Near vienna, but relatively low cost. Seems to be growing in leaps and bounds and has a well educated populace.  Environment of low regulation and capitalism, so this could be the startup hub of the next decade.  Might not be that now.<p>Big Cities in Asia-  There are a number of candidates here, from Manila to Bangkok. Seems the creation of a middle class has unleashed a wave of creativity and desire to create internet startups amongst the youth in asia.  Hong Kong is an obvious possibility.<p>But these are just impressions.  We'd like to find a place where there is the possibility of having relatively low costs, since the access to venture capital will not be the same as it would be if we were in the Bay Area.<p>But access to talent, and more importantly, a startup culture seems like it would be really valuable.<p>But where can you find this best outside the US?"	08206038	Tomte	Tomte	Why Racket?

Then 8 months later, in September 2013 she finished her Master study in the US and returned to her home country. She was appalled to find out that her credit card has been charged a $39.95 fee for the last eight months. Yes, $39.95 for 8 months, without getting anything from JustFab.<p>I then did a bit research on the internet. It turned out my girlfriend wasn&#x27;t the only victim. Apparently JustFab works like this: once you buy something from their website, you become their &quot;VIP member&quot; without your knowledge. Then you will have to log into their website between the 1st-5th of each month and click â€œSkip This Monthâ€ù. If no action is taken (either skip this month, or cancel your account), they just charge you a $39.95 fee every month.<p>According to article published on BusinessInsider, JustFab &quot;generate about $100 million this year&quot; in sales, I wonder how much of this $100 million are from people like my girlfriend who simply didn&#x27;t read their entire 2,500 words Terms of Service and were unaware that they were charged $39.95 a month for nothing.<p>[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;justfab-sews-up-40m-to-become-global-fast-fashion-empire&#x2F;<p>[2] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;justfab-has-raised-another-40m-led-by-hong-kongs-shining-capital-to-take-its-fashion-subscription-commerce-model-to-asia&#x2F;<p>ps. This is a re-post of my last year&#x27;s post [3], hoping it will get upvoted to the frontpage of HN so that more people get to know the shady business JustFab does. Apparently VCs don&#x27;t do due diligence any more, as long as scam companies like JustFab can bring them money.<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4592778"	05684773	westicle	westicle	Depression Part Two	240	1368163458	2013-05-10 05:24:18 UTC	977		07440305	byoogle	byoogle	"Mt.

But maybe that just means it has gotten mainstream.<p>But anyway I like the Python philosophy that there should preferrably be one obvious way to do things.

Newsflash: competent programmers apparently have a skill that is extremely rare. Rare commodities are expensive.<p>It strikes me as senseless to complain endlessly about how 199 out of 200 candidates who are interviewed for a programming position are literally incompetent. No competent hiring manager should put out more than one ad posting which attracts a horde of unqualified candidates. Why not? Because the second time around he will offer a much more attractive salary.<p>And that's really the end of it.

Never received Bitcoins"	475	1387393150	2013-12-18 18:59:10 UTC	658	"This story dates back to December 8th when I initiated an ACH transfer with CoinBase.com for a total sum of $35,104.11. On that very same day, the system informed me that I would be credited with the bitcoins come December 13th.<p>December 13th came by and it was this past Friday. No coins ever came in, the only thing CoinBase did was lock in a price for me @ $868.91. Again, they locked in a price and didn&#x27;t give me coins on the day they told me they would deliver the coins.Ever since the 13th, my transaction page has been showing the following:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;R2qEn8E.png<p>As you can tell, the funds cleared their end on the 11th. BUT... it still says pending for crediting the coins.&lt;p&gt;This is how the history page looks like:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;BQ4fUwZ.png<p>Just take a look at that...it actually says that the transaction has been completed here.<p>Let us now look at the email conversation:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;6SQht98.png<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;eNlIS0V.png<p>I gave their team eight hours to get back to me and settle the issue. They have now missed that deadline so I am taking this matter a bit public. Further avoidance by them will lead me to make a few calls to news stations. I have the right contacts to easily put myself in the media.<p>Now the real dilemma for me here is the fact that while CoinBase.com has locked in a price for me, because they have failed to deliver I cannot sell my coins at any rate. Bitcoins could drop down to $200, and only then might they deliver the coins. The issue at that point is that I would be down a crazy percent already. If they had delivered the coins on the 13th as they had initially promised to, there would not be this issue.&lt;p&gt;Give me a break, the company just secured $25m in VC and this is how they are treating their clientele.&lt;p&gt;"	08458865	InternetGiant	InternetGiant	Feminist video-games talk pulled after massacre threat	323	1413386401	2014-10-15 15:20:01 UTC	149		-18888747	davmre	davmre	Obama calls for municipal broadband	275	1421266752	2015-01-14 20:19:12 UTC	520		05927726	gagan2020	gagan2020	Obamaâ€™s crackdown views leaks as aiding enemies of U.S.	217	1371998909	2013-06-23 14:48:29 UTC	224		-12509967	mambodog	mambodog	"Woman removes SIM card from smart energy meter, uses $193k of 3G data"	201	1304431394	2011-05-03 14:03:14 UTC	166		16395148	intenex	intenex	My Friends and I Bought an Island	387	1379358551	2013-09-16 19:09:11 UTC	832		08417234	brbcoding	brbcoding	Reddit CEO Calls Out Former Reddit Employee on Reddit	294	1412619164	2014-10-06 18:12:44 UTC	366		03186476	moconnor	moconnor	I swapped my MacBook for an iPad+Linode	338	1320239621	2011-11-02 13:13:41 UTC	634		09935830	berberich	berberich	The Weakness of the .NET OSS Ecosystem	207	1437660871	2015-07-23 14:14:31 UTC	172		05937296	chrismealy	chrismealy	Google Reader Apocalypse Extremely Fucking Nigh	267	1372130001	2013-06-25 03:13:21 UTC	479		06917194	ferrellw	ferrellw	"NSA phone surveillance program likely unconstitutional, federal judge rules"	231	1387222109	2013-12-16 19:28:29 UTC	748		07809024	libovness	libovness	How Apple Cheats	228	1401268036	2014-05-28 09:07:16 UTC	348		02252152	tianyicui	tianyicui	Solving The Hacker News Problem	270	1298418287	2011-02-22 23:44:47 UTC	407		04999406	danso	danso	SQL Injection Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails; affects all versions	205	1357161931	2013-01-02 21:25:31 UTC	402		07353283	warrenmiller	warrenmiller	The Face Behind Bitcoin?	678	1394109344	2014-03-06 12:35:44 UTC	1165		09231302	dr_	dr_	New Jersey legalizes direct Tesla sales	219	1426766607	2015-03-19 12:03:27 UTC	430		07227820	EMRo	EMRo	Tell HN: My Brother Died Last Week.

He tells me about how he found the Libre Office spreadsheet and he&#x27;s been filling out his work documents (he works in high-end custom home construction) with it and transmitting it with Google Docs.<p>Then he tells me that he was able to add their house printer and print his docs from the machine using the instructions from Ubuntu&#x27;s help system.<p>I was pretty much floored. My parents are NOT technical people. I offered to get him a Windows license for the machine but he said that it&#x27;s working fine for him.<p>People make jokes about the &quot;year of desktop Linux&quot; but if my dad, without calling me ONCE, can use Linux productively to get things done, then, in my opinion, Microsoft is in trouble. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, their claim to usability in the PC OS world is dying.<p>Maybe this doesn&#x27;t mean a whole lot in the big picture, but Linux has cost Microsoft at least one end-user license for an average computer user.
