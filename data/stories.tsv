"In \How to Make Wealth\"" PG puts forward the following argument:<p>1. Assume a hacker can make a good wage working for someone else.<p>2. Assume a hacker can in turn be significantly more productive working for themselves.<p>3. All things being equal, a hacker should be able to make significantly more money by working for themselves (albeit at the cost of increased risk and stress).<p>The relevant quote: \""If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smart hacker working very hard ... should be able to do work worth about $3 million a year.\""<p>My question to HN is as follows:<p>Excluding outliers such as Gates/Zuckerberg, is the inference that a good hacker can make more from the market directly actually valid?<p>If so, why does it seem most hackers struggle to capture even <i>half</i> their regular wage from the market directly?<p>All advice/experiences appreciated."""1028418	nsoonhui	nsoonhui	122	1262515765	2010-01-03 10:49:25 UTC	262	Balsamiq Makes 1.6 Million with

This is a result of being mentioned on more mainstream sites. I hope this spike will subside, like past ones have.  In the meantime I may temporarily hack a few things to make the site faster, like putting fewer results on threads pages.<p>You can help the spike subside by making HN look extra boring. For the next couple days it would be better to have posts about the innards of Erlang than women who create sites to get hired by Twitter."1326270	mjfern	mjfern	122	1273192294	2010-05-07 00:31:34 UTC	270	What iPads Did To My Family	http://chucksblog.emc.com/chucks_blog/2010/05/what-ipads-did-to-my-family.html9956415	samfpetersen	samfpetersen	134	1438016283	2015-07-27 16:58:03 UTC	270	Show HN: A Hand-Drawn QR Code Alternative	http://www.meshtag.com1299029	wyclif	wyclif	160	1272391050	2010-04-27 17:57:30 UTC	270	Learn Python The Hard Way: a new book by Zed Shaw	http://learnpythonthehardway.com/2281045	brown9-2	brown9-2	115	1299096363	2011-03-02 20:06:03 UTC	526	Man upgrades Windows 1.0 to Windows 7 (video)	http://www.winrumors.com/man-upgrades-windows-1-0-to-windows-7-via-every-other-windows-versions/8602936	cpenner461	cpenner461	158	1415901729	2014-11-13 18:02:09 UTC	526	AWS Lambda	http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/4627106	feronull	feronull	159	1349708240	2012-10-08 14:57:20 UTC	526	"Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and others launch webplatform.org"	http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/08/apple-facebook-google-microsoft-and-others-join-forces-to-launch-new-web-standards-resource4068561	krschultz	krschultz	196	1338903497	2012-06-05 13:38:17 UTC	526	"Kids should be building rockets and robots, not taking standardized tests"	http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2012/06/maker_faire_and_science_education_american_kids_should_be_building_rockets_and_robots_not_taking_standardized_tests_.html218664	blang	blang	80	1213628205	2008-06-16 14:56:45 UTC	15	Ask HN: Do you swear in your code?

"I am a full-time software developer looking for extra income. I spend a lot of time &quot;cold-emailing&quot; local businesses and messaging other companies who are actually looking for applicants. The result is always the same: &quot;we are not looking for freelancers&#x2F;contractors right now&quot;.<p>I have also used freelance sites before (unsuccessfully) like ODesk and Elance, and I have really hated how they work. It seems like all freelancing on those sites is a price war. I am confident about my skill-set and I&#x27;m not worried about not being able to deliver, but the way bidding is organized on these sites feels really demeaning.<p>So ultimately, my question for HN is how do YOU find or establish new freelance&#x2F;sub-contracting&#x2F;contracting gigs? Should I just deal with my annoyance at ODesk&#x2F;Elance or are there methods I&#x27;m missing? Thanks!"5898576	ArabGeek	ArabGeek	124	1371555345	2013-06-18 11:35:45 UTC	275	Facebook is Blocking Connections from Tor Network	http://arabcrunch.com/2013/06/facebook-blocks-log-ins-from-tor-browser-putting-thousands-of-political-activist-at-risk.html3884723	Braasch	Braasch	132	1335285247	2012-04-24 16:34:07 UTC	275	Google Drive	https://drive.google.com/start3020459	ramen	ramen	139	1316571722	2011-09-21 02:22:02 UTC	275	Windows 8 OEM specs may block Linux booting	http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/205255/windows-8-oem-specs-may-block-linux-booting9074704	hashx	hashx	166	1424361625	2015-02-19 16:00:25 UTC	275	"Microsoft Is the New Google, Google Is the Old Microsoft"	http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/02/18/microsoft-google-swap/?9625641	yla92	yla92	153	1432917709	2015-05-29 16:41:49 UTC	531	Project Jacquard	https://www.google.com/atap/project-jacquard/4323597	whoishiring	whoishiring	292	1343836582	2012-08-01 15:56:22 UTC	276	Ask HN: Who Is Hiring?

"I've just finished sophomore year at a good liberal arts university.<p>I have two more years left here; what should I try to do? What should I bias for? What do you, someone who is no longer in college, wish you did, and found most useful during your time there?<p>More about me: So far, I've spent most of my time learning how to do work, then how to do hard work, and about myself (ADHD, etc). (In fact, I'm procrastinating right now.) I spent most of my childhood doing what I was interested in (lego, then computers), which doesn't develop the skills needed for college.<p>I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics double major, but I'm not sure if I'm clever enough for pure math; I am aceing the CS classes, though. I'm vaguely participating in a startup-like venture, but there is little pressure, and hence little actual startup atmosphere - but still good experience. I've thought many times about dropping out (of college), but I seriously don't have a plan, aside from the vague notion of \going to SF and figuring something out\"". Besides, it seems like a good idea to get a college degree + the CS/Math sophistication alongside it. Nevertheless, I'm quite bored, by the vapid partying (which I refuse to take part in - decimating my social life), the happy-go-lucky attitude of most people, and lectures + homework in general.<p>My life goals? I want excitement (see ADHD, above). Maybe with computers. The current startup frenzy seems to fit like a glove, but I've only heard about it on the internet."""176251	ashu	ashu	96	1209438390	2008-04-29 03:06:30 UTC	24	My Mac Mini	http://mattmaroon.com/?p=3597745547	RougeFemme	RougeFemme	117	1400094004	2014-05-14 19:00:04 UTC	24	"'I'm Happy,' Says Man Whose Case Changed Europe's Rules For Google"	http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/05/14/312430713/-i-m-happy-says-man-whose-case-changed-europe-s-rules-for-google364219	bbuderi	bbuderi	163	1226668505	2008-11-14 13:15:05 UTC	24	"Attention, Startups: Move to New England.

My wife is in biotech, so someplace that offers something for her is high priority too (once again, the bay area would be good, but... not with a kid, and having to drive <i>everywhere</i>).<p>Anyone got a favorite mid-sized town that might not easily pop up on the radar, that more or less fits the bill?<p>Incidentally, this doesn't have to be in the US.  We would be in Padova, Italy if everything else were equal, but the political and economic situation in Italy is not pretty right now.   A romance language would probably be easier to deal with (indeed, I'm looking at an opportunity in Portugal).<p>Thanks guys, Dave"""1667920	AlexMuir	AlexMuir	116	1283829669	2010-09-07 03:21:09 UTC	27	Ask HN: what does Microsoft sell that you can't get for free?

"I am coming back to the IT industry after about 6 years of being involved in something completely unrelated. My partner and I are starting a startup that�۪s going to make a online blogging application for a niche market. If we are successful, the application would need to be able to scale to handle a lot of users (100k visitor per day if we are successful, nothing like FB levels or something). Because it�۪s going to be a blogging platform with a business model similar to squarespace.com, the load will be distributed over many different domains, making it easier to scale.<p>Both my partner and I have good knowledge of PHP. However, due to the complexity of the project, we will have to find additional developers anyway. From what I read online Node.js and Go are the in thing right now, and scale much better than PHP. My question is, should we stick with the ���Devil we know,�۝ PHP, or dive into learning and developing in Node.js or Go. Should we consider another programing language &#x2F; platform?<p>What are your thoughts. This are honest questions, we are just looking for some feedback.

"I'm fairly new here (I'm a refugee from Reddit) and occasionally I read comments where someone complains that a post isn't appropriate or that the standard of conversation has gone down recently.

That things will gradually get unbearable and that when they do the people who built up this site will just move on and found a new community and the whole process will start over.<p>Is there a plan? What's stopping 100,000 Digg users hearing about HN on TV and showing up with posts on Obama's latest news and pictures of their cats?<p>Clearly there's the code behind the site, the karma system and minimum thresholds for downvoting and so on. I've also seen people linking to the guidelines (http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html) occasionally, to try shame people into behaving themselves.<p>I've got to be honest though, I can't see anything that's fundamentally different about HN that means it will avoid the fate of those other sites. You let me register, what's to stop others? Do you have to \Accept\"" the guidelines when signing up? I can't remember, even if you do though, let's be honest, nobody's going to read that.<p>I don't know, do you think HN is structure well enough to prevent it happening? Is there a special plan?
